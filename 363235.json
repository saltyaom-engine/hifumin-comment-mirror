Kirito's strong, but you're deluding yourself if you think he's a self-insert. You'd have to ignore the multiple scenes where he needs someone else to save him, where he fails, and where he comes out feeling like shit. Second arc is literally a power fantasy deconstruction, where Kirito goes into the game trying to use his strength to make him feel better about himself, only to realise that such a mentality is fucked up and wrong. \n\nFeels like Kirito is stronger in the minds of SAO haters than SAO fanboys. Like yeah, no shit, when you ignore a character's weak moments, and exaggerate his strong ones, he's gonna seem like a self insert.\nAlso : \"get all the bitches\"\nKirito's only interested in and only has been interested in one girl: Asuna. He has no intention of going the harem route, and it's doubtful Asuna would let him if he wanted to. Barely has even 5 min of \"harem romcom drama\" in the whole 4 seasons of anime either."},{"id":1979145,"gallery_id":363235,"poster":{"id":1250559,"username":"Jackforest","slug":"jackforest","avatar_url":"avatars/1250559.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1630160302,"body":"Ntr where Kirito was never going choose any of them "},{"id":1834423,"gallery_id":363235,"poster":{"id":1104066,"username":"Kuutearica","slug":"kuutearica","avatar_url":"avatars/1104066.png?_=7cb763677e776941","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1624758189,"body":"The good ending."},{"id":1821556,"gallery_id":363235,"poster":{"id":1714639,"username":"Yurifag95","slug":"yurifag95","avatar_url":"avatars/1714639.png?_=963aa231e8a81f9c","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1624271599,"body":"THE COVER LIED TO ME.
