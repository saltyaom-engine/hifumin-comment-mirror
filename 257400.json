UBW Good End shows that Rin+Shirou together can keep Saber from disappearing so he shouldn't need the entire city to power her, just Rin (for anime only people, that was a second ending for UBW where Rin realises Shirou cares a lot for Saber, and she sees a chance to force Shirou off the Archer path using that (she is also sexually attracted to Saber, admits it in the Fate Path). She keeps the contract active after the Grail shuts down, using her mana as the anchor and battery that keeps Saber incarnated. As she alone isn't quite enough, Shirou has to stay with them both to provide \"mana\" to her and Saber regularly, stopping him from going off on the quest that makes him Archer)"},{"id":1130451,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":3497845,"username":"crackheadmiller","slug":"crackheadmiller","avatar_url":"avatars/3497845.png?_=5844acfd636f606e","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1596829404,"body":"pain. just pain."},{"id":991126,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":732603,"username":"Tristan182","slug":"tristan182","avatar_url":"avatars/732603.png?_=eedd23ca5af4c68b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1591771438,"body":"Hey Siri, why is Gen Z the most depressed generation? \nAnswer: This hentai :("},{"id":861845,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":1239038,"username":"h8GW","slug":"h8gw","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1554071630,"body":"That was hot........right?"},{"id":834341,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":2064664,"username":"NotPaz","slug":"notpaz","avatar_url":"avatars/2064664.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1551634355,"body":"We have HUGE DEPRESSION "},{"id":813626,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":2059565,"username":"nazoreturn","slug":"nazoreturn","avatar_url":"avatars/2059565.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1549824475,"body":"Tristan, play the shit out of despacito"},{"id":786100,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":1638043,"username":"Alvatarti","slug":"alvatarti","avatar_url":"avatars/1638043.png?_=66947db50ae67055","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1547387217,"body":"Have been long since I have gotten hurt by a doujinshi.

This is a well rounded doujinshi is not that unique as i did expect when i first saw the tags. The problem, but in the same time the benefit of this one is that it may be a modern production doujinshi with modern standards but it doesn't try anything new. Its the classic tentacle rape using the old, but not outdated by any standards, fate series.\nI have to give this one a 3/5, again, a solid formula, but i would like to see more creativity and ingenuity in the future."},{"id":769133,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":2124283,"username":"KV222","slug":"kv222","avatar_url":"avatars/2124283.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1546094818,"body":"YEEEEEEEEET"},{"id":768973,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":329290,"username":"frozen ink","slug":"frozen-ink","avatar_url":"avatars/329290.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1546076334,"body":"my dick is too sad ..."},{"id":768966,"gallery_id":257400,"poster":{"id":541398,"username":"ElectrX","slug":"electrx","avatar_url":"avatars/541398.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1546075473,"body":"Oh this is fucked up...
