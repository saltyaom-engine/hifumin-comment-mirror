The allure of ero-guro is the inherent ability to stir the self. Whether it be the grotesque that stirs unfounded emotions or the erotic beauty of suffering itself, ero-guro is an inquisitive tool to understand more about oneself through the medium of story. Disgust that churns at your stomach- is a rare emotion that can be addictive and is one of the few things that make me feel truly alive. Which is why it frustrates me that we've got eyeball gouging, amputee stump humping, decapitated throat fucking and my favourite- intestine or brain fucking BUT STILL there is no dick chopping. Fire in my loins at the thought of a pristine penis balls deep in the throat of a lady, and decapitate the throat and pulsing dick simultaneously with a tremendous axe. And yet, it does not exist. Must I really be the first guro artist to endeavor on this affair so as to allow my passion for guro dick chopping to exist?"},{"id":2017829,"gallery_id":51520,"poster":{"id":1294660,"username":"ClockworkGod","slug":"clockworkgod","avatar_url":"avatars/1294660.png?_=d43bca3412a18875","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1631693844,"body":"this is nota thing that belongs here.
