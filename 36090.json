It was called \u201cvercomicsporno\u201d and it contained zootopia, dragon ball, the simpsons porn. I might have acquired my (kinda) bestiality fetish from there, and I kept falling and sinking lower and lower. At some point, I arrived to hentaifox, and when it got ads for every page you flipped, I moved to nhentai. I managed to stop the loop of searching for more and more depraved hentai by remembering the first reason my younger self wanted when it browsed porn, \u201cI want care and love\u201d. Or something along those lines. Well androginity is the peak of hentai, both tomboys and tomgirls. I achieved eternal post but clarity after fapping to tomgirls one too many, and now I\u2019m here, awaiting salvation. I wanted to be a decent artist, but I haven\u2019t drawn something since last year dec. I\u2019m leaving that dream here in case I\u2019m again depraved enough to come here. Remember future self, be an artist and shock the world."}]
