Thanks to the manga creator who put 2 pages of scat in there(not 1), these people tagged it as scat. You seem to believe whoever made this tag \"accidentally\"(due to a lack of major fetish) should be replaced, but really you could've think twice before saying something better. Anyways, if you see a page of scat, would I tagged it as scat ? Yeah. Why? Because it's scat in there."},{"id":792496,"gallery_id":260260,"poster":{"id":1218031,"username":"Schmand","slug":"schmand","avatar_url":"avatars/1218031.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1547935194,"body":"@It feel good It's the exact thing it says, low amount of scat. Aka not a major fetish in the work but only present in like 1 panel. Don't tell me why that's a thing, the ones who make the tags at sadpanda are braindead.
