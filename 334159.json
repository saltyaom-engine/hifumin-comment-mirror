The bullying just continues and she starts to genuinely hate her own body even though to anyone else it seems so insignificant. at the point the bullying just reinforces her negative beliefs and could very well trigger a desire for self-harm in order to cope. the moral of the story is that people are sensitive, and something that seems like nothing to you could be a huge insecurity or cause of stress for others, but even if those people don't believe it anymore, they deserve to be loved too.
