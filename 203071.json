To determine her actual aproxamate height, we use the picture dimensions(1280x1807) and the pixel count of the spec(although it could be different based on the author's ideas.  I'm not sure) which is somewhere between 3x4 and 5x5.  Further assuming that their growth is perfectly static, we can count their pixel-to-image ratio on page 12 we can take a ~1080:4(270:1) Lunarna-to-solar system ratio.  Therefore she would be ~77.614 trillion kilometers."},{"id":1870949,"gallery_id":203071,"poster":{"id":2710695,"username":"Animepopcorn_","slug":"animepopcorn_","avatar_url":"avatars/2710695.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1626246913,"body":"One of the measurements in this are inaccurate, I'm afraid.  The first few are hard-ish to accurately determine, as there aren't any specific buildings or landmarks to base their supposed height on.  In the example, in page 29, her height is 16,000 KM.  But using the Earth as a reference, we can count pixels and estimate a height of ~12.7 Earths, or 161,823.4 KM, which is certainly within margin of error.
