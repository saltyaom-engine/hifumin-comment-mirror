MC after hearing this askes her if he also is just another dude she used for her own pleasing and reasons, but even after learning this he still loves her. After that, he never saw her again and there's a time skip. After crossing paths with her she says to him \"Thank you\" and while he watches her go thinks \"Are you happy now?\". So yeah, the ending was a bit confusing but since I used MTL something probably got loss in translation.

So MC confronted her and she showed him her husband(?) died so she fell into depression and maybe got NTR'd(?) by some delinquent (gyaru-oh) guy. MC sympathized with her and cried after finding out the truth. 3 years later, he came back as his friend(or someone he knew) came to pick him up and stumbled upon his sensei again who seemed to had gotten another man but then (this part seemed a little confusing) MC started reminiscing and thought about meeting her again(?)."},{"id":1527799,"gallery_id":345408,"poster":{"id":3606436,"username":"John Peels","slug":"john-peels","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611671928,"body":"This is a trash "},{"id":1527758,"gallery_id":345408,"poster":{"id":3761260,"username":"ys.moon","slug":"ys-moon","avatar_url":"avatars/3761260.png?_=15d0895a138df071","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611670264,"body":"Could someone explain to me the story/plot?"},{"id":1527755,"gallery_id":345408,"poster":{"id":3747092,"username":"Xentratos","slug":"xentratos","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611670254,"body":"It could have been so good"},{"id":1527750,"gallery_id":345408,"poster":{"id":3747092,"username":"Xentratos","slug":"xentratos","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611670132,"body":"It could have eben so good."}]
