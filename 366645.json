Defloration is far from the only tag they're missing... They consistently miss soooo many obvious ones like smell, sweat, and armpit licking. All of these are pretty much in every one of Warabimochi's work and are usually a focus. Very unfortunate because a lot of people won't find these, I literally have to search the artist directly to find it because I know it's never tagged properly."},{"id":1894352,"gallery_id":366645,"poster":{"id":2453199,"username":"JohnMichealGarcia","slug":"johnmichealgarcia","avatar_url":"avatars/2453199.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1627135514,"body":"WHERE'S THE DEFLORATION TAG?!"}]
