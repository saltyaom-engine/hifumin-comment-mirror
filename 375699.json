In both act 10 and 11, the guy is Kei, the protagonist from the original game. Due to a car accident, Kei suffers a special kind of amnesia, which resets his memory every 14 day. So the guy we see in the beginning is simply Kei from the previous \"cycle.\"\nBecause he met his step-mother Akiko, and Akiko's daughters/ his half-sisters Chika and Haruka (two girls we see at the end; they all share the same father) just before or after the accident, he would forget about them every 14 day. So they would re-seduce him after every 14 day. \n"},{"id":2063863,"gallery_id":375699,"poster":{"id":2753260,"username":"dragevard","slug":"dragevard","avatar_url":"avatars/2753260.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1633528285,"body":"Wait...
