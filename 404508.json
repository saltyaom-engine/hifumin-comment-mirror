It was her armor that turned into tentacles and she was wearing it before she entered the cave, it couldn't have been easily replaced. That ending might imply the true nature of the flower knight -&gt; beautiful exterior but \"tentacle\" interior. The statue of the EARTH goddess having worm-looking things also work with this theory.
