Just the fact that this little worm of crackler had the audacity to draw that pile of shit makes me wish and pray that he should get into a terrible car accident. I hope that he loses all his limbs, eyesight, genitals and gets so horribly burned across his entire skin, that only his nose tip remains unscratched. But even than he should survive as a pain ridden lump of flesh. So that he gets some divine punishment for drawing that shitty picture. Let the flames of purification get over him. (Sorry but anime fans can be weird sometimes)"}]
