I kind of recognize it, but I can't for the life of me put a name on it. Is it a gerbil? I don't know why, but that name just resonates with the animal I'm seeing displayed on the cover, even though I know it isn't one thanks to a quick google search I just did. If someone holds the answer to my question, please comment it on here, I beg of you."}]
