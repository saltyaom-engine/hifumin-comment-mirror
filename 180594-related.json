There is also that it elludes this is just what her ideal relationship is in her head, the last part when she kicks the guy looks a lot like faceless-kun and that is her encounter with him, whereas everything else is just what she \"picked up\" from her magazine. (which if it is just what she learned/imagines, and the fact it actually follows all the previous volumes, makes me worried now that she will just discard him.
