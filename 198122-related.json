The only way this could be remotely canon is if this yet another one of the delusion Alisa's broken mind has lapsed into do deal with horrible situation she landed in after accidentally making an rival out of ruthlessly ambitious Colette. Of course even for that to work you'd need to ignore the fact that his short is set in totally different era then that of the actually Fanaticism plot line."},{"id":137760,"gallery_id":198122,"poster":{"id":914996,"username":"mikethemaster2012","slug":"mikethemaster2012","avatar_url":"avatars/914996.png?_=f32eb7bf305fe9a1","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1499440949,"body":"Alternative happy end for them I am glad for the characters. :)"}]
