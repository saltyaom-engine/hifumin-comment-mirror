I guess it wasn\u2019t only me then. Even the author as well through the characters lol. Wish the series had a good ending. Maybe like 4 chapters more would have been enough to tie things up."},{"id":1674222,"gallery_id":23185,"poster":{"id":3419092,"username":"zikakuto","slug":"zikakuto","avatar_url":"avatars/3419092.png?_=447dcb06b77e5440","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618199134,"body":"Honestly does she really like MC too. I mean she\u2019s using sex with him to feel good about herself, because there\u2019s someone who loves her. Compared to the sex before that was just carnal to fill the hole, assuage her guilt, and feed her addiction. It\u2019s like this is a whole new addiction, but she can make this work by doing things for him. Kinda feel like she\u2019s imposing herself on him, because she\u2019s so confident he has feelings for her."},{"id":1674214,"gallery_id":23185,"poster":{"id":3419092,"username":"zikakuto","slug":"zikakuto","avatar_url":"avatars/3419092.png?_=447dcb06b77e5440","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618198965,"body":"Wow, Sei changed so much. The earlier volumes she was totally anti-sex. And now she\u2019s throwing herself at him constantly. Pg 35 made me laugh. She said, \u201cVagina for Mamoru only.\u201d Girl, we know you had your problems and you\u2019re trying to change, plus that was your past, but she\u2019s coming off so weird, it\u2019s a huge turnoff. I like a lot in the story but there\u2019s a bunch of stuff in the story that really disappoints me. She, Tomo, and Kaoru still need some resolution to their part of the story. Kaoru was the reason why she became addicted to sex. His actions served as the catalyst to her downward spiral and her almost taking her own life. Which he treats so casually with a smirk, so fuck him. Plus the betrayal of Tomo, one of the nicest characters and a person they supposedly love can\u2019t be just ignored and brushed off when it was the second most important reason for Sei\u2019s descent. She was planning to call Tomo and confess so that needs to be followed through."},{"id":963620,"gallery_id":23185,"poster":{"id":2197050,"username":"-Ara_Ara-","slug":"ara_ara","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1562215449,"body":"Fiquei procurando a parte do gemder bender e nao achei"},{"id":868968,"gallery_id":23185,"poster":{"id":1451093,"username":"Garruk1","slug":"garruk1","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1554733138,"body":"o altor deveria acabar logo a serie do Ochiru Tenshi porque e muito boa."}]
