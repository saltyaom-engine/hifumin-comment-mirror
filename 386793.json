I start with a full pornagraphic story and slowly replace sex scenes with action or dialog until I have a regular story. It's a thing I do. Fuuga just didn't convert to regular story. He left it halfway through. But its fine. I know other people use different methods for making their respective stories. Also, Eseru brought up a topic I've been wanting to talk about. I hate when a hentai ends with the main characters left fucking away as if they're going to be fucking each other forever. I want to see what happens to them 5 to 10 years later. You think a 15 year old boy is going to be fucking his mom 10 years later? I don't think so. You think a 10 year old girl is going to continue letting her daddy fuck her every day? I'm sure she'll kill herself after a while or finally tell someone. (POLICE! ) I'm interested in seeing what happened years after the end of the story."},{"id":2288073,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":3890311,"username":"Supermatt8","slug":"supermatt8","avatar_url":"avatars/3890311.png?_=f0031962cd4e3947","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1643100252,"body":"Interesting plot, erotic sex scenes and great artwork 10/10"},{"id":2260955,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":4105123,"username":"CulturedSubaru","slug":"culturedsubaru","avatar_url":"avatars/4105123.png?_=4d91b2dd583d19a4","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642045719,"body":"What an amazing series.

Bad hentai. Thanks for translating it so non-JP readers can read Fuuga's work, KenGotTheLexGs. Anyway, if anyone is puzzled by the ending, I think it was hinted that Rei and Mei's mother and her brother may have had sexual relationship in the past too (as he smiles looking at them holding hands and how much she cared about him). And to think there's no actual confirmation Re and Mei are actual blood siblings...Well... They also started to realize their current \"relationship\" will not last, but they chose to live the present to the fullest anyway. One day they may ended up like their mother & uncle. At some point, Masato and Aki may break up and Rei can finally get what she wants from the start. Who knows. I guess Fuuga need to polished his skills at telling stories and start his own non-H manga series one day. You can tell how much this series was held back by its hentai shell instead being actual manga. 8/10 for me. Not as good as \"Teacher and Student\", but good read."},{"id":2246657,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":3637164,"username":"Esas","slug":"esas","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641477782,"body":"very nice!"},{"id":2246634,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":4432309,"username":"KageSeishin24","slug":"kageseishin24","avatar_url":"avatars/4432309.png?_=286bf99ae493b694","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641476866,"body":"Summarize please"},{"id":2246538,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":2463074,"username":"Milkyy","slug":"milkyy","avatar_url":"avatars/2463074.png?_=da2510a806f45bd8","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641472409,"body":"sum anyone ?"},{"id":2246524,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":2360097,"username":"I hast come","slug":"i-hast-come","avatar_url":"avatars/2360097.png?_=1b27924d795e9e78","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641471939,"body":"Good shit, heavenwing needs to chill out"},{"id":2246463,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":2181037,"username":"otomono","slug":"otomono","avatar_url":"avatars/2181037.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641468768,"body":"the brother lived/lives a miserable life.Can't imagine the mental forttitude he needs to get through each day.\nOne of the best closures from fuuga"},{"id":2246452,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":3441815,"username":"AssMan=GoodMan","slug":"assman-goodman","avatar_url":"avatars/3441815.png?_=7502f7c87fdea910","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641468485,"body":"Happy ending, also the guy below me has a place reserved in hell"},{"id":2246437,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":996591,"username":"heavenwing","slug":"heavenwing","avatar_url":"avatars/996591.png?_=4421b80dffe50180","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641467890,"body":"That's it? no swinging thingy.."},{"id":2246375,"gallery_id":386793,"poster":{"id":3439768,"username":"Curiosity Killed the Cat","slug":"curiosity-killed-the-cat","avatar_url":"avatars/3439768.png?_=87994e8693e8071a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641465744,"body":"Well this is just superb...
