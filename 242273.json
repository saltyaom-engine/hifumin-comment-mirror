Often time, though, despite the fact that I derive some guilty pleasure from reading this genre of doujin, I do wish that artists such as, Asanagi, Mochi, Kiyoshirou Inoue, etc. would create something a bit more wholesome once in a while; like Rocket Monkey. I mean, I love the art of these artists, but sometimes I just want to read something from them that makes me feel warm inside, rather than cold.Basically, I wish these artists were a bit more rounded. Still, these are nice works, and I will continue to read them, but I just wanted to voice my opinion on the matter. Anyone else feel this way? I would love to hear your opinion :)\n"},{"id":655175,"gallery_id":242273,"poster":{"id":641961,"username":"Atang","slug":"atang","avatar_url":"avatars/641961.png?_=02c80c202ecd3ae8","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1534123824,"body":"mochi stop"},{"id":654575,"gallery_id":242273,"poster":{"id":25571,"username":"Frozzy","slug":"frozzy","avatar_url":"avatars/25571.png?_=738fe647d8f406fe","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1534079719,"body":"those last few pages should have been the whole thing"}]
