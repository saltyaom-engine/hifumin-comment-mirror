I love how he/she draws cuz he/she adds up extra shading and details to have a sense of realism, Shiroo pretty much does it in a way that feels extra erotic and damn it is present over here, this is a simply yet another fantastic work by Shiroo, I can literally not look away due to how logical, beautifully drawn, well positioned, hot and cute everything looks, I give this one a 9/10, and I just realized Shiroo got this idea from a 4 page comic he drew a while back, glad it finally got fully realized."}]
