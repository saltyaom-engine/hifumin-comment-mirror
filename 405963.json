And so I simply find it incomprehensible that you're still devotedly reading every new chapter (and even go as far as checking out the raws) despite your dislike for it. Tbh, many people do this so I ain't singling you out here. I just so happen to notice how consistent your ranting is for this series. My intention isn't to stop you from sharing your thoughts and theories for this doujin. In fact, now that it seems like you don't necessarily dislike this series (correct me if Im wrong), the best takeaway from what Im saying here is to be more aware of how your words paint an image of yourself from now on.
