To the apes, he even shared his blood, so the apes holds a fragment of magical power in them. The apes, who now calls their race as human, multiply and eventually raised their weapon against the Dragon King, whom they now call Demon King. At least that's the lore from the dragon's side, no story from human's side."},{"id":2518279,"gallery_id":402781,"poster":{"id":1581302,"username":"genmurei","slug":"genmurei","avatar_url":"avatars/1581302.png?_=fef231bcad72a280","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1652313901,"body":"What the actual fuck"},{"id":2518167,"gallery_id":402781,"poster":{"id":2655024,"username":"Tij","slug":"tij","avatar_url":"avatars/2655024.png?_=b529f383234ef893","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1652309126,"body":"translation asap pls"}]
