Look at those works tho, the attention and love put in the drawing is just way too excessive to be regarded as solely commercial commission. Don't know if you have read the vanilla GITS books, there was surely some solid sf settings but the characters are just very different from the tv and film adaptation (like Motoko, in the book she was much, much on the talkative and energetic side). You can just tell he genuinely LOVES eroticism as much as science fiction. As an erotic artist he still goes extra, extra miles to create beautiful fictional scenarios and lovable characters. The only bad I'm seeing here is his arranging of elements and the sheer amount of writing made this a translation nightmare lol might as well add one more reason to learn the language"},{"id":163415,"gallery_id":200888,"poster":{"id":693625,"username":"o homem biscoito","slug":"o-homem-biscoito","avatar_url":"avatars/693625.png?_=70f667e647c0942b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1505022346,"body":"Que del\u00edcia, cara!"},{"id":153789,"gallery_id":200888,"poster":{"id":1071055,"username":"PentacleMonster","slug":"pentaclemonster","avatar_url":"avatars/1071055.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1503007062,"body":"@gerent.  I really don't know what to say.  His works like GITS and Appleseed are great, but i haven't seen anything new from him since the Skycrawler movie and some Appleseed movies.  Frankly, I wonder if he does this stuff on the side or decided to move to hentai because it is easier to write and stuff?
