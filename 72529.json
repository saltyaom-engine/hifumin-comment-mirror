Everything pisses me off. Everything he did, from that shit making her horny, the sex, and cheating and lying and hurting Tomo was the fucking worst. Like he felt no guilt or anything. Just felt scared he was gonna get caught. I can imagine how angry and betrayed he\u2019d be if Tomo cheated on him. But he\u2019s all cocky cause he said he can get any girl. And he\u2019s being portrayed as a somewhat good guy or something. Just need to rant. I absolutely hate what Sei did too. How can you do that to your friend, Tomo may not forgive but she\u2019s an angel to act like it\u2019s no big deal despite being obviously eaten up about it. She deserves honesty. Too bad the series will never end, but some sort of resolution where the Sei and Kaoru apologize and ask for Tomo\u2019s forgiveness would be nice."},{"id":1400586,"gallery_id":72529,"poster":{"id":1961683,"username":"Weeb hunter","slug":"weeb-hunter","avatar_url":"avatars/1961683.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1607765968,"body":"The plot...inside mari perhaps?"},{"id":1385903,"gallery_id":72529,"poster":{"id":1052472,"username":"A Certain Crossdressing Touma","slug":"a-certain-crossdressing-touma","avatar_url":"avatars/1052472.png?_=0adb4fee00706545","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1607189524,"body":"180+ pages of flashback.
