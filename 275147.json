As I said, it\u2019s lackluster, it\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s just that compared to the last couple releases we\u2019ve had, I personally find it to be on the weaker end of the spectrum overall. I recognize that there are some \u201cdomination\u201d-centric doujins in here, it\u2019s why I stated \u201cmost\u201d instead of \u201call\u201d. But to me, personally, even those fall a bit short in comparison to other works by the authors in various aspects. All of this is my personal opinion on it though, obviously I\u2019m sure a good number of people are gonna love this *because* it\u2019s mostly vanilla, it\u2019s just not where my tastes lie."},{"id":937657,"gallery_id":275147,"poster":{"id":1603431,"username":"just_uwu","slug":"just_uwu","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560353266,"body":"My main reason for watch this is the wholesome comic put at last.

Maybe it\u2019s the fact that most of them are just straight romance-vanilla without even a semblance of \u201cdomination\u201d (I\u2019m fucked up, so are all of you, deal with it). But I just personally find it to be lacking, and I\u2019m usually more accepting of vanilla with Lolis, because it\u2019s -generally- inherently  \u201cdominating\u201d in portrayal.\n\n P.S I really don\u2019t like where Hikoma Hiroyuki is going with this series. He\u2019s extremely talented, so I truly hope he doesn\u2019t stick with this vore-egg-tentacle shit (tentacles are relatively okay, the other 2 are not) and simply goes back to making some truly god tier -normal- loli doujins.
