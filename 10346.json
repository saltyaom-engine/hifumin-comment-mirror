Shame the maid didn't take Sayuri with her. Could have shown more rape scenes of the Kaede when she was young and her mother. All in all, it was pretty good aside that the girl is now pretty much bound to her house and probably in a straight jacket. Shame Kaede didn't take her with her. \r\nOne of the pages is broken as well."}]
