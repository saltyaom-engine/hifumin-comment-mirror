PM Gals was such an intoxicating series to read, its plot was as good as a potatoe but it's hentai nonetheless - it's also worth noting that PM Gals works as a series because of established character interactions mixing itself with hentai - we have an idea of how the characters act and if the doujin can mimic the characters personality it feels like we're reading excluded parts of the story.\n\nS&amp;M doujins that include the main male protagonists are incredibly hard to follow if they aren't incredibly drawn - for male protagonists in pokemon don't have a compelling personality.\n\n"},{"id":906752,"gallery_id":272394,"poster":{"id":2454576,"username":"RealTaeko_13","slug":"realtaeko_13","avatar_url":"avatars/2454576.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1557985441,"body":"Short, but good"},{"id":906601,"gallery_id":272394,"poster":{"id":3082,"username":"precita","slug":"precita","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1557972395,"body":"Way too short, but it seems like this artist was trying to mimic the Gambler Club PM Gals doujins."},{"id":906305,"gallery_id":272394,"poster":{"id":42268,"username":"Tae_22","slug":"tae_22","avatar_url":"avatars/42268.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1557947236,"body":"I'm gonna fuck'em all"}]
