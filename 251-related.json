Gonna try doing some more constructive criticism.\nThe art on the first manga was in my opinion acceptable but not good, for example the thin bodies are a huge turn off for me since they look like an hourglass. On the second, it was unrefined, a quick draw worked on for far less time if compared to the first. The third and last one, it looked too childish, the actions were exagerated to try to bring the comedic value that, if done correctly, can better a Manga.\nOverhaul, while the art stared acceptable, since it is a multi work book, the other two, that are less than mediocre will make the score go down.\nIn the end i give this one a 3/10."},{"id":1819807,"gallery_id":251,"poster":{"id":4439494,"username":"cobyob12","slug":"cobyob12","avatar_url":"avatars/4439494.png?_=8e85ba82dda72527","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1624211893,"body":"Art style was actually decent for a change but I have a feeling the Evangelion saga is gonna continue 5.6/10"},{"id":1818634,"gallery_id":251,"poster":{"id":2305919,"username":"bulba2020think","slug":"bulba2020think","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1624170047,"body":"Art style was professional like but I felt like I was missing something cause I couldn't understand the story 5/10?"},{"id":1144826,"gallery_id":251,"poster":{"id":3546359,"username":"fuggindude","slug":"fuggindude","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1597385968,"body":"If you are reading this comment your parents will die within 5 years.
