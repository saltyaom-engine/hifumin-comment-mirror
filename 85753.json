Like, you can clearly tell they like the Loli, but even considering that everything they write is so deliberately OUTLANDISH in design.. it still always feels like a lot of thought was put into the characters and mutations. Nothing ever feels like it was just slapped on for the sake of being there. For me at least, it also is a big selling point that there is always a proper story, especially with Drainage city. I don't think I would have cared about that series at all if it wasn't for the awesome way it slowly fills you in on all the people living in the drainage city, while also following how they change as time progresses."},{"id":136704,"gallery_id":85753,"poster":{"id":842752,"username":"Anczar","slug":"anczar","avatar_url":"avatars/842752.png?_=a590080fe2c958d2","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1499185744,"body":"Idk why im so fascinated with his work.."},{"id":126423,"gallery_id":85753,"poster":{"id":798009,"username":"Darkwatcher10","slug":"darkwatcher10","avatar_url":"avatars/798009.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1496594432,"body":"That...was a wild ride from start to finish.
