Mc is frustrated cus Gf won't fuck with him and Fmc also has someone she likes but dude don't seem to be interested in her, so Fmc and Mc become fuck buddies. Then they go on a school trip or something and Gf finally decides to fuck with Mc but now Mc seem to be more interested in Fmc. Because Mc is now busy fucking with GF Fmc starts fucking with some random dude she met during the trip since the dude she liked is too already fucking with someone else (tanned girl). Mc starts getting jealous and Gf notices it. Gf realizes Mc is interested in Fmc, so she starts fucking with some other random dude she met at at the beach. Fmc catches Gf in the acts and scolds her. Gf says she knows about her and Mc. Fmc says it's a misunderstanding... And so far this is the story.

Page 621 shows her accepting the beach dude groping her. A few pages later, the MC and her are having sex, but I think she's imagining the beach dude in that scene. She imagines him while the MC begins to imagine the glasses girl while fucking her, which makes him cum immediately. From the looks of it, SHE doesn't cum, which comes as a shock to him (meaning he busted early most likely since he never had an issue making a girl cum before). The following chapter, she fucks the beach dude and MC fingers the glasses girl while she blows him and everyone cums.

You'll most likely feel NTR vibes just cause of what I said earlier. The tanned dude on the beach fucks the brown haired cover girl, the girl the MC was crushing on, but she only accepted his advances because the MC was looking at the glasses girl while receiving a blowjob from her, which shocked her and told he that he didn't really love her, despite the sex. I caught NTR anxiety around the final few chapters of this update, but that was mostly due to the realism of the situation and I kinda shipped the brown haired girl and the MC. But it's an experience she grows from, because she and the barista girl from page 52 drops the tanned beach dude completely. But no one is in a real relationship here. Not yet. It's more like adolescent experimenting where they make mistakes but grow from it.

That one girl that runs that shop introduced on page 52 is probably the only thing I would potentially call \"cheating\". If you read, you would see that she had sex with the MC's friend in that bar. He probably took that as a sign that they were going out, but I assume the girl just saw it as casual sex and she appears to have realized that her carelessness hurt him about 2/3s of the way through. The manga starts with the girl in glasses getting rejected by her crush and I assume the MC also got rejected, so they start their own sexual relationship to cope and work on a way to actually get their crushes, but no one is definitively going out in this manga. Not to my understanding. So it's not cheating by the normal definition. Just a whole lot of unrequited love and finding comfort in sex with others who share the same \"heartbreak\" in a sense.

Definitely one of the most layered hentai stories I've read since Metamorphosis by ShindoL. I didn't even cover all the other side stories, but you can sort of infer from their reactions. The main story is between the 2 cover girls and the MC and by this time, the MC and the redheaded girl end things. Probably a little reluctantly, but accepting that it wasn't gonna work out. The \"antagonist\" of the story up to this point was likely the tanned dude their with on the trip. Didn't like him the entire time cause he was just molesting everyone and playing it off as a joke.

This is why I likened this to Scum's Wish. People start confusing sex with love and love with sex and start using sex as a means to cope with unrequited love. It started to bother me because the red head girl, the MC's crush, while he's blowing him, sees that HE'S looking at the girl with glasses having sex and that bothers her. She starts to look elsewhere (the tanned dude with the hat) and that's where the NTR anxiety kicks in (at least for me) cause we watched the MC build up a relationship somewhat with this girl and he's a pretty standup dude, he just doesn't have his feelings together.

If anyone knows the manga Scum's Wish (Kuzu no Honkai), this is basically the same plot, just more light-hearted (at least for the majority. It starts getting more dramatic and fucked up when they go on this trip about half way through). But basically, everyone likes someone else. The MC likes the red headed girl on the cover, but the girl with glasses appears to be his sexfriend/bestfriend and she likes one of his friends. Go to page 191 to see the full love rectangle. Throughout, the MC and the girl with glasses try to get with their crushes. The girl with glasses doesn't really work out so she just happens to have a passionate time with the longer blonde haired dude. The MC fucks his crush a few times but soon begins to miss his sexfriend (Sort of like Toradora here a bit where Ryuugi and Taiga both had crushes but they spent so much time supporting each other that they ended up falling for one another.)
