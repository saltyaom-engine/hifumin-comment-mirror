But what makes it disgusting is that they treat it like her being raped and blackmailed and made to be gangraped, etc is romantic cause he knew her from before and he changes. Like wtf, she\u2019s gonna forgive, fall in love, and feel safe with her rapist?! It\u2019s one thing when we have the usual bizarre hentai logic in your usual hentai, but this story has pretensions to being deeper but it\u2019s message is fucked up."}]
