There is no honor in being an easy guy... A dense person is not that, it is rather the sheep too simple-minded and too weak to resist their own impulses or to devote themselves to a woman, without succumbing to the advances of others. Some see it as a symbol of virility, I see it as just vulnerability... \n\nYou must not be a reliable guy, just a bovine who proudly spends his time going after everything that moves like a mangy dog in rut, addicted to his sexuality and indecisive in love. If a woman goes elsewhere because she wants to rush into a relationship or make a superficial commitment to someone she hasn't taken the time to know, then she just doesn't deserve love at all. Bell is a much rarer man than the 90% of adventurers who look like you and would be rejected with contempt by reserved women like Aiz or Ryuu. Ryuu said it herself, they are not worthy of her company. As for those who fantasize about the suffering of others, you do not deserve to live."},{"id":1977464,"gallery_id":137490,"poster":{"id":2618742,"username":"EscanorLeBeau","slug":"escanorlebeau","avatar_url":"avatars/2618742.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1630094778,"body":"deserved, bell is a punk. the curse of the harem mc. either a punk or too dense to make a choice "},{"id":1913908,"gallery_id":137490,"poster":{"id":4148110,"username":"I Eat Orphan","slug":"i-eat-orphan","avatar_url":"avatars/4148110.png?_=b2f2ffcdc169a16d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1627834494,"body":"This shit with shit"},{"id":1637318,"gallery_id":137490,"poster":{"id":3038709,"username":"psychopath666","slug":"psychopath666","avatar_url":"avatars/3038709.png?_=55008a986a98b061","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1616600279,"body":"TRASH \ud83d\uddd1 ASF"},{"id":383284,"gallery_id":137490,"poster":{"id":1604188,"username":"Grimmoire","slug":"grimmoire","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1520443463,"body":"Djabilong I think you forgot that he is just a 14 year old boy, anyways Bell is not like that anymore, If It was the current him in that situation, he would beat them all till they had their bones broken due to pure rage or even kill them."},{"id":369520,"gallery_id":137490,"poster":{"id":1378180,"username":"Djabilong","slug":"djabilong","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1519116498,"body":"This shit here is why I dropped the manga.
