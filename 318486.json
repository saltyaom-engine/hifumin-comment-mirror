I started it just because I did't want to pay someone for a translation and wanted to share the rough understanding of the sauce, it's not perfect in the slightness but we churn one out every 2 weeks and as of right now we are prioritizing overlord and will do all but 3 due to personal preference of the team.

If that's how it acts then its probably a build ruining meme item. But if it lets you keep the levels put into race-specific occupations and race levels it's completely broken because it lets the user have the abilities of a race and race-specific occupation without any of the downsides. Like for example, the undead class has a super long list of all sorts of weaknesses like fire and blunt damage weakness. But if the item lets you change your race and you were still able to keep your race-specific occupations like Overlord in Einz's case which is a heteromorph and undead only class/occupation. Or Einz's race levels in undead as a lich then it's just a game-breaking overpowered item that lets you basically be undead without any of the weakness."},{"id":1042049,"gallery_id":318486,"poster":{"id":3338040,"username":"hflan","slug":"hflan","avatar_url":"avatars/3338040.png?_=bdbacc5178f1508c","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593405391,"body":"Oh my god this actually killed me the plot is so good but because it's Einz it's so unintentionally funny."},{"id":1042004,"gallery_id":318486,"poster":{"id":3286959,"username":"Crappy Translator","slug":"crappy-translator","avatar_url":"avatars/3286959.png?_=e36d1c47a241452a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593403496,"body":"Sorry for the re -upload, did not have credit to translation(I didn\u2019t upload the first one)"},{"id":1041591,"gallery_id":318486,"poster":{"id":2235157,"username":"HeteroGuy","slug":"heteroguy","avatar_url":"avatars/2235157.png?_=cd0310857587632a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593385357,"body":"Btw very wholesome, really gud."},{"id":1041540,"gallery_id":318486,"poster":{"id":2235157,"username":"HeteroGuy","slug":"heteroguy","avatar_url":"avatars/2235157.png?_=cd0310857587632a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593383424,"body":"Actually, it would be Momonga Human form in the game, if he turns human from his Skeleton form, not Momonga irl."},{"id":1041500,"gallery_id":318486,"poster":{"id":989243,"username":"Mysterious Syringe Man","slug":"mysterious-syringe-man","avatar_url":"avatars/989243.png?_=00716be384458b98","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593382041,"body":"did momonga really look that old tho? what i saw from recap is \"typical anime young man\" type of character"},{"id":1041415,"gallery_id":318486,"poster":{"id":2793054,"username":"KingKuro12","slug":"kingkuro12","avatar_url":"avatars/2793054.png?_=8e9056de3f613de7","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593378402,"body":"Lolicon?
