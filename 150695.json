(let me clarify, its really great and i would fap to it again!) This doujin to me is like saying that Yami has a weakness that can be exploited. and that really irks me because her invincibility to everything is one of the many things that makes her my absolute favorite character of all time. even though the one fucking her over is oddly herself, i cant let it go. i have been abstaining from Yami doujins ever since i fell in love with her. so after 6-8 years of avoiding these, i finally thought to just give it a go. so seeing the jojo reference at the end, i expected a light hearted kind of doujin.. i guess some artists just must get their fix of NTR huh. when im good enough to make doujins of this level, i pledge to be a full vanilla artist! Folks remember my name! 3 years from now, ill be there. my pen name will be borderline! or kyokai or something along those lines haha"},{"id":55701,"gallery_id":150695,"poster":{"id":240057,"username":"Sekaisan","slug":"sekaisan","avatar_url":"avatars/240057.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1470146754,"body":"I thought i wont let it get to me but im just gonna let it all out. First off, it takes a trigger to activate darkness so her reappearing is highly unlikely. Furthermore, unlike nemesis, Yami does not run on dark energy. she is a human clone. be it and alien.. err human err.. trans weapon clone. but we see that she ingests food. also never in the entire 10 years of to love ru, be it from the original or from darkness, did yami ever needed sustenance from another energy source besides food. So, i highly doubt she will be able to conger up enough energy to materialize darkness again with just earth food. \r\n\r\nto my next point, yami clearly remembers what happens during the time where she was darkness. so in this case, yami would already have known that they had sex and there wont be this kind of odd NTR feeling."},{"id":38172,"gallery_id":150695,"poster":{"id":368456,"username":"NotusHomus","slug":"notushomus","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1455035075,"body":"dat za warudo reference hahahaha"},{"id":27764,"gallery_id":150695,"poster":{"id":136562,"username":"BonerKun","slug":"bonerkun","avatar_url":"avatars/136562.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1449818427,"body":"This fucking author gets me every time with the based Jojo endings."},{"id":27703,"gallery_id":150695,"poster":{"id":20957,"username":"Asbrand","slug":"asbrand","avatar_url":"avatars/20957.png?_=a8d6cefbc03013a9","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1449727976,"body":"Nice, really nice."},{"id":27642,"gallery_id":150695,"poster":{"id":196786,"username":"Midori0san","slug":"midori0san","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1449611911,"body":"Yet again Men's and his jojo parodies at the end..."},{"id":27639,"gallery_id":150695,"poster":{"id":83261,"username":"YakoVex","slug":"yakovex","avatar_url":"avatars/83261.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1449611182,"body":"God this artist makes great to love ru doujinshis."},{"id":27638,"gallery_id":150695,"poster":{"id":198047,"username":"invisoperv","slug":"invisoperv","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1449611096,"body":"HALLELUJAH!
