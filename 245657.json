The characters do not act like themselves at all, and I struggled to attach their voices to the writing (especially with no accents to be seen). This could be a translation oversight, but it goes further than that. On page 6, Rex says, \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into me\u2026? Normally I would never do something like this.\u201d which makes no sense considering the lack of awareness we see from Rex in the main game. Considering Rex\u2019s response to Nia\u2019s blade reveal in chapter 7, it is safe to assume the moron would have no impulses to begin with, for any of the women in the game. Then again, we do have the post-battle dialogue between the two that would suggest he is not completely unaware.

It makes no sense for a single blade in the party to forget, let alone the wise Dromarch, if this were even the case. This is the Aegis we are talking about here. We see multiple times from the game that Pyra does not recover normally (a side effect of sharing her core crystal with Rex) as opposed to Malos who we see recover just fine (if not better than your average blade) from Nia\u2019s cancer bubbles, also in chapter 7.

If nothing else, the events of the story would make the most sense post-game. We know for a fact this is not the case, considering the still-cracked core crystal (and ignoring the more obvious). I initially thought the doujin took place on the Argentum Trade Guild, but a second viewing leads me to think Torigoth, Gormott. I went in-game to check the inn\u2019s, finding that it takes place in Torigoth due to the lantern and door visible during the doujin. Considering the complete lack of Mythra and the location, I would say that it takes place before or during the beginning of chapter 3, but this is debunked because we see Brighid and Zeke talking on page 22, meaning Morag and Zeke are in the party, meaning this must take place later than chapter 5. Problem is, the party does not go to Torigoth any time after chapter 3, bar Rex\u2019s hallucinations in chapter 10.

A neat concept, but we do not see Rex and Pyra sharing anything other than pain during the story. We see them sharing physical injuries, not emotions or dopamine. Feel free to correct me on that, it is not something I could easily fact-check with Google. Lastly is this whole poison thing. There is no such thing as a poison debuff in XC2. I originally thought it had said \u201cvirus\u201d and I was going to go on this whole rant about the \u201cBlade Virus\u201d move that enemies such as Mk. VII Arek have, but no dice. What could have been a better explanation is the \u201cLove Source\u201d item from the DLC Sidequest \u201cMaking Love Source\u201d which would have explained my initial theory of this taking place in Argentum. The item increases driver and blade trust by 3,000 and would make for a much better premise.\n\nIn conclusion, this doujin sucked. I could not get half-way through without going limb.
