The third volume was never completed and Distance dropped the series sadly. Maybe he couldn\u2019t figure out a way to end it happily or satisfyingly. I mean she sleeps with her best friend\u2019s boyfriend in volume 2 and hurts her terribly. The guy is a dipshit though, but her actions were also a great betrayal. Or maybe he just got tired of the series, etc. Who knows if he\u2019ll ever return to it but I don\u2019t think he will.
