Let me explain, when Shinji was at his breaking point during the film and wished that humanity would become one due to his fear and hate towards the rejection from love that he has dealt with for his entire life. He was able to create and experience a alternative reality different from his own (for example, Ep 26's alternative reality where Shinji is not a pilot and changes his relationships thereby changing himself as well. Another example would be the cut  sequence in End Of Eva where Shinji doesn't exist and it follows Asuka in a world  without Angels.)\n\nSo in Instrumentality, it is confirmed that anyone can create a reality that caters to what they desire, the ultimate form of escapism (which is fitting, considering how Eva's point was to fight against the concept of escapism) so these doujins could take place in fake worlds created by people still in Instrumentality."},{"id":205379,"gallery_id":209596,"poster":{"id":443731,"username":"Deacon","slug":"deacon","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1506454120,"body":"how does Mogudan keep coming up with this stuff? we must preserve his perverted mind for science."},{"id":205184,"gallery_id":209596,"poster":{"id":261212,"username":"Nudeclear","slug":"nudeclear","avatar_url":"avatars/261212.png?_=347810fb81a2da19","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1506440092,"body":"DESTROYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}]
