I'll have to let you know, because you might just be ignorant, that you are trampling on his rights by doing that. Lacaio is allowed to speak his opinion on this doujin without people like you trying to stop him. You say \"There's no out of 10 score\", but there very much is. Perhaps not for you, but for Lacaio and sometimes me aswell. Of course, as the most satisfied existance, there is rarely something that is even close to 10/10. Of course, you might refute my argument by saying \"It is my opinion\" which is technically correct, but you're forcing that opinion unto Lacaio, which is trampling on his rights. Your opinion is that there is no out of 10 score, which I fully respect, but do not force it unto others. After all, I, the sin-archbishop representing Greed, Regulus Corneas, hate when my rights are trampled on."},{"id":2617982,"gallery_id":409121,"poster":{"id":4074794,"username":"Hentaiwatchers","slug":"hentaiwatchers","avatar_url":"avatars/4074794.png?_=7312790598bf5206","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1656681400,"body":"Yuri is good for your body"},{"id":2617795,"gallery_id":409121,"poster":{"id":3959512,"username":"Myers gaming","slug":"myers-gaming","avatar_url":"avatars/3959512.png?_=9e6b03ed24372bec","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1656672129,"body":"YYUUURRRIII!!!!!"},{"id":2617703,"gallery_id":409121,"poster":{"id":3102832,"username":"yakoswag","slug":"yakoswag","avatar_url":"avatars/3102832.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1656666868,"body":"@Lacaio it's hentai my man.

Long version: Well, normaly it'll be a straight 7/10 because the drawing are good but it isnt detailed and can be really bad in some pages. Plus the history is pretty basic with the climax being a bit meh but it is a Machikado Mazoku doujin, and there's few of then so it'll be a 8.5/10 because this aint a 9/10 in anywhere."}]
