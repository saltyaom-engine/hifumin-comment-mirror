I also love some of the episodes of the Cream Lemon anime, especially Pop Chaser and Star Trap. I think the former easily has the best lesbian scene out there (not just anime, also compared to movies). It basically did the Blue is the Warmest Color sex scene decades before that movie came out... except better and with cuter girls."}]
