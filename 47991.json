'if ___ then they weren't really brother'. Please. What world do you live in? Family is the most heinous of horrible people you will ever know, because you are 'family' they feel they can do whatever they want. Are all members of a family evil shit bags? No. But being 'family' being 'blood-relatives' means precisely JACK SHIT. Their blood isn't going to boil, explode, or in any other way stop them from doing terrible shit to you and everyone you love. You don't owe blood anything. When someone turns on you, you turn them out. End of story. This guy should have just axed the first black shade bastard right when he started raping the mermaid, and then knew what to do for the next two."},{"id":118653,"gallery_id":47991,"poster":{"id":1119130,"username":"ShirasakaKou","slug":"shirasakakou","avatar_url":"avatars/1119130.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1494356368,"body":"Why must you wound me so?"},{"id":67732,"gallery_id":47991,"poster":{"id":326572,"username":"ImAGuest","slug":"imaguest","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1476827592,"body":"I remember a story more or less like this described in a manga. Only there wasn't rape, nor a mermaid, and the guy gaved away his body, piece by piece to devils. Or was some forest animals? I don't remember anymore. I remember the guy died with a smile on his face, but those who got the body parts were making fun of him. It was a story to teach about don't givin away somethign important for you without reason. And I'd have cut the leg of those brother. With a rusty, blunt knife.
