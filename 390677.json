Since the whole premise of the story is that Juria has been in love with Rin since they were little kids and first met. But since their both girls Rin is hesitant about the whole thing seemingly thinking it's not right. So to \"turn\" Rin, Juria runs around and starts turning everyone into yuri and hooking up with girl after girl just to make Rin jealous and eventually turn yuri as well. Then the \"happy ending\" is that Juria has finally managed to turn everyone they know into Yuri and she and Rin get's together so happy ending! So the story is filled with manipulation, NTR, cheating and to some degree brain washing to eventually have Juria end up with Rin."},{"id":2311136,"gallery_id":390677,"poster":{"id":4659379,"username":"gamboli","slug":"gamboli","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1643989233,"body":"Noo im not pirating...
