Other than that, it was absolute shit.\n1/10.\nAlso, are you good bro? The one before the last is literally fucking before a Baki character appears and kills everyone. Where is the story in that? Why didn't the author develop that character better, like him being sister of the girl raped, and showing him earlier to let us know that he exists before appearing out of nowhere to rip heads.\nAlso, Also, I don't know what you liked to read, but I strongly hate mangas with no story and if you look closely enough, you'll find a ton of them. This is one is exactly how you described these \"horrible new ones\"."},{"id":1472440,"gallery_id":1006,"poster":{"id":515167,"username":"kenji_online","slug":"kenji_online","avatar_url":"avatars/515167.png?_=9983eb2ae7bc5343","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1610097575,"body":"u are reading this comment your parents will die within 5 years.
