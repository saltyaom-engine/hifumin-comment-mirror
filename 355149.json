Fire and water are also technically alive. because they grow. consume, and spread. but you see despite its technically meets the requirements to be that, sometimes you have to make exceptions based on things like Logic, and common sense. and for the same reason fire and water isn't alive because of logic and common sense. despite it meets all three requirements of *being able to consume things, *being able to grow, and *being able to reproduce. liking traps isnt gay because gay men would never be attracted to them, and lesbians would. if you think its gay i bet youd fuck one of those reveres traps that are literally women but look 100% like a dude, and think it's totally straight of you. so see, despite it technically is, in all honesty and seriousness we all know it isn't. This concludes that debate."}]
