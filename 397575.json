This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks."},{"id":2428268,"gallery_id":397575,"poster":{"id":1832024,"username":"BKXDDDDDDDD","slug":"bkxdddddddd","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1648664633,"body":"Nice.
