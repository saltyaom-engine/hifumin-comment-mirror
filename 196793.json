We live in a world where disorder is the natural state, but at a special time when color, outlines, and identity emerged from entropy. Inside us all is not a desire, nor an instinct, but a counter-instinct, pushing us into a black hole where our color becomes mud, our outlines become one plane, and our identities become a collective. There is no true villain in the story, and no one group is at fault, there is only the unliving fog that birthed mankind and her beckoning for our return to her womb.

But rather than meeting weak, conquerable white men, and even weaker disorganized futas, he encounters a stronger than expected diluted combination of both, hence the \"marriage\" of the two. His hundred-year plan backfires and is easily overpowered by an invisible force, namely, high-level natural disorder. The Jew had created an enemy which was strong enough to resist his power, but too weak to be self-sustaining, and thus his miscalculation had dragged into the downward spiral that he had planned to keep a distance from. The story closes with the dominant culture's animalistic celebration of mankind's eventual demise.

Notice that the futas are strategic, however, and only seek to convert a few of the weakest European men to start with (the small dicks). The motif of a boat is used to emphasize the power of the one who controls it. As one scholar put it,\"On boat you arrive as conquerers, on boat you return as the conquered.\"A boat, or ship, rather, is an allusion to Western Imperialism and colonization, where ships were employed and often dragged with them the ominous silhouette of the Western ultimatum. After some time has passed and a frighteningly elusive number of ships have already departed, we yet again meet our protagonists who arrive on unconquered land. The \"men\" are used to set an example and establish the social norms of multi-culturalism. The strategy is to permeate rather than invade and use explicit manipulation."},{"id":387486,"gallery_id":196793,"poster":{"id":1454962,"username":"fresh start","slug":"fresh-start","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1521107766,"body":"@WarAngel the artist's intention is for it to be laughably absurd and simplistic. The storytelling and pacing itself reflects the irrational, sudden, and somewhat depressing feminization of first-world men and their desire to submit to both women and third-world men (symbolically represented here as futas, thus having both genetalia and greater vitality). The men here are depicted as resilient and reluctant to give up their culture so easily, and resist the conditioning and re-education at first. They are defeated after persistent harassment and one especially brilliant metaphor: the white men are at a tense moment in time where they are outnumbered by futas and conversion is clearly inevitable, [now pay attention this is where you take notes] rather than flailing and screaming and eradicating this tumor through their own self-destruction and admittance to failure, they instead willingly give up their role in society, and see it as a victory; they actually believe they have been freed."},{"id":151684,"gallery_id":196793,"poster":{"id":1179024,"username":"XpussydestroyerX","slug":"xpussydestroyerx","avatar_url":"avatars/1179024.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1502586023,"body":"I came to this "},{"id":144968,"gallery_id":196793,"poster":{"id":1090247,"username":"WarAngel","slug":"warangel","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1501006688,"body":"This is the stuff that earns nukes.
