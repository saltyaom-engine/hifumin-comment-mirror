It's not stated how old anyone is or how long they've been single, so it makes sense for her to try relationships with people. Except she says that she's loved the guy for years. So even though she's in love with someone she still had sex with other people. It's not really wrong since she couldn't have known he returned her feelings and she shouldn't have to wait for him before trying to start a relationship. But any awkwardness someone might find in this situation is because of how nonchalant she is about taking her cousin's first time while stating she's been in love with him for years and clearly not having waited. Justifiable, but a little awkward IMO."}]
