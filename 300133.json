The queen loves the knight but the king stole her from him (talk about the cliche abuse of authority). I know that they are not in a relationship but they are both in loved with each other so it can be under NTR. \nToo bad that the king has her body and Bud doesn't know that she loves him but there's nothing can be done about it. Well, at least the king is a scum who left his responsibility for the country so there's still hope that these two would end up together. "}]
