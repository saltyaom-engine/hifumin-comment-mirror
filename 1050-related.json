Maybe I'll live knowing that everything that I did was wrong. What matters is that, wrong, my life already is. I hope that everyone that reads this tries not to fall to the same hole as I did. Use me as a stepping stone of what not to become, use me as a stair to get out once you fall, use me as a disposable tool to understand the mistakes without commiting the error. It doesn't matter to me. Just be better than I will, am or even was. 1/10."}]
