Needs a 2nd chapter. Bonus note: Do you peeps find it odd that vampires can cure wounds and remove scars but never a \"broken hymen/deflowered pussy/penetrated vagina\"? call it whatever you want."},{"id":1693435,"gallery_id":227755,"poster":{"id":1769963,"username":"Shiro Ecchi","slug":"shiro-ecchi","avatar_url":"avatars/1769963.png?_=10f6b076542f3552","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1619111759,"body":"PG 40: Fukurou no Yakata"},{"id":389615,"gallery_id":227755,"poster":{"id":416871,"username":"shikabane","slug":"shikabane","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1521446137,"body":"yeah, the continuation of Fukurou no Yakata!"}]
