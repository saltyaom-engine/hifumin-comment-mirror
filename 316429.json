This is refreshing. In fact, there is something about this that somehow makes it up there with the \"idealized fantasy colorful expression\" approach that the japs have all seemingly, universally adopted since they learned about alice in wonderland, which led to sally the witch, which layed the groundwork for their over the top \"give them blue eyes and blonde hair, claim she's 100% japanese and its creator doesn't even know what genetic natives europeans/russians are, never seen them~\" culture (eh, sailor moon?) Like that pudgy face, it's a \"less makes more\" thing. Also like it when they put the concept art prototypes that were considered and compare them to the final product, can see that simplicity was the main intentional point here. And the mc is realistic too instead of the usual \"garysuke stumaru\""},{"id":1005780,"gallery_id":316429,"poster":{"id":452643,"username":"calculi","slug":"calculi","avatar_url":"avatars/452643.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1592146323,"body":"i really like the art style.
