Fakku sub is credit card only. Do u get a credit card in any country easily? No. For example I don\u00b4t have any way of actually buying a subscribtion due to not having the necessary income/expenses to succesfully apply for a credit card in my country. (ever herad of paypal? No? It\u00b4s only one of the most commanly way used  to do online transactions. Does fakku has that for theier sub? No.)\n\nSecondly the author doesnt get a penny from fakku due to them having contracts with the magazine publishers who pay theier mangakas a fixed amount per work. So dont give me that shit \"herp derp support the artist\" cause thats just bullcrap.\n\nThridly  the sub for one month that is over 10 bucks is rather pricy  for theier limited content and while I see why some peps could argue that u don\u00b4t have black bars (I couldnt care less for black bars they dont bother me \n\n"},{"id":115906,"gallery_id":193652,"poster":{"id":698415,"username":"Feronen","slug":"feronen","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1493593449,"body":"Also, this is 2016-08, not 10."},{"id":115905,"gallery_id":193652,"poster":{"id":698415,"username":"Feronen","slug":"feronen","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1493593320,"body":"So you expect artists to make your porn for you for free?
