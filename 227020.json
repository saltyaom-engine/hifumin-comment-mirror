I really don't know how I should feel about this series. It started out amazing, with sweet characters and great art, but the ending feels a tad bit disappointing. It was never even really explained, why they can't interfere. I think in chapter 3 she said something about \"they would become the laughing stock of the universe, if they did that.\". Okay... I think that's still a better option than letting a whole civilization with billions of people die. It makes the alien's motives seem really odd. Like as if they just pretend to care, but they actually just care about their \"intergalactic reputation\" and their little life seeding experiment. Also makes this \"Greatest single mothers in the universe\" panel seem rather odd. How does \"Let them die, we can just start all over again and again.\" fit in with that? Sorry, if I ruined this for anyone.
