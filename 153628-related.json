He makes it a point to ask about her in conversation, noting some kind of abnormal closeness). As the uncle wakes up from dozing off in the bath, he says 'I wish I had summer holidays again' upon hearing 'onii-chan'. His comment later saying \"Disgusting...or it isn't?\" kinda shows how he feels the inherent disgust but can't judge them because of the conflict he feels. \r\n\r\nI actually thought it was pretty well thought out and stands out compared to the story on most doujin... It's awfully minor and subtle, but there's even subtle hints of subterfuge like when the uncle asks if Naoki (the brother) went with her. There's not a whole lot of reason to waste page space to point these sorts of things out if they're not important, you know?"}]
