I think she plans on handing it over to her husband who will do the rest! (I think that was the main plan, she might have known Kyouko is starving for sex while planning her revenge and brought up her husband COUNTING on her attempting to approach him for Sex, seeing they have a \"S&amp;M\" relationship and his behavior! It's clear she ordered him to have sex with her if Kyouko askes him and take a picture afterwards). Also it's hentai, I've seen NTR where the girl COULD use her status and money, but instead falls for the old \"I got pictures\" game and has sex with NO guarantee he'll get rid of it nor deals with him when he makes NEW ones he wouldn't be able to make if I don't know \"SHE DIDN'T FUCK HIM! It's called \"Idiot Ball for the sake of plot!\" and yes it is a terrible method to use!"},{"id":2493472,"gallery_id":401200,"poster":{"id":1242965,"username":"SanMig","slug":"sanmig","avatar_url":"avatars/1242965.png?_=2bc89387284fa4fd","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1651445106,"body":"@LordCellofEarth9 blackmail is useless if kyouko knows how to use her cash machine"},{"id":2493189,"gallery_id":401200,"poster":{"id":1841102,"username":"YoungMetro-senpai","slug":"youngmetro-senpai","avatar_url":"avatars/1841102.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1651430364,"body":"No T-Pose?"},{"id":2493028,"gallery_id":401200,"poster":{"id":4955457,"username":"ashcash1234","slug":"ashcash1234","avatar_url":"avatars/4955457.png?_=81c24942589c50a0","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1651424433,"body":"Milf ....."},{"id":2492872,"gallery_id":401200,"poster":{"id":5176896,"username":"KalvinEllis","slug":"kalvinellis","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1651419392,"body":"Seems like she really underestimated missus whisper tits. lmao"},{"id":2492809,"gallery_id":401200,"poster":{"id":4447563,"username":"Marquis de Sade","slug":"marquis-de-sade","avatar_url":"avatars/4447563.png?_=dfea5947c56c497e","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1651417073,"body":"no T-pose, no dominence...

There really isn't such a thing a \"sympathetic cheating\" in that YEAH her husband is an ass, but he isn't wrong that she's dependent on him and if she didn't like it, she can leave.
