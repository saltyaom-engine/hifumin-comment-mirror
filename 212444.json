Frankly in it's attempt to be \"anti-vanilla\" it's created a new genre of \"anti-NTR\" such as Revenge NTR (not the Netori ones) where the BF/Husband actually gets revenge or the Vanilla disguised as NTR where the NTR guy does the NTR tropes only it fails cause in a realistic lens it shouldn't be able to even WORK! Or fake-out NTR where the NTR guy succeeds at the rape part, but gets punched by the BF and the GF turns on him instantly! Never having fallen (a stab at that stupid trope of \"his cock is bigger, therefore he's the better man and she falls in love in a \"love at first fuck\" manner! She knows she's being raped and the moment she gets the upper hand, it won't end well for him!). I mean I saw a typical \"Picture Blackmail\" where all the guy had was a picture of the girl's \"ponytail and nothing incriminating\" yet apparently it worked in scaring her!"},{"id":2015928,"gallery_id":212444,"poster":{"id":1228339,"username":"yashamalu","slug":"yashamalu","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1631610643,"body":"NTR plots are all stupid, the BF only needs to take picture of the teacher doing the GF,  send it to her parents and he can get revenge on both of them.
