Mion loves Keichii too much, Shion got hooked in having sex with him, Rika i'd say she got used to seeing them having sex due to plot reasons, Rena would be devastated but she most likely would chop Keichii to pieces and finally Satoko never killed anyone so she's innocent. Blunt object perfectly fits for a man, so my guess would be... hmm... Satoshi? He got jealous of him xd (ofcourse if only he'd got out of his disease and not commit suicide right after waking up from coma or was it induced coma? I don't remember)"},{"id":1647863,"gallery_id":353153,"poster":{"id":2415924,"username":"potatomann1","slug":"potatomann1","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1617028652,"body":"What a good timeline"}]
