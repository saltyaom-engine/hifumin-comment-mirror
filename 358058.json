And the girl has been waiting for him in the old apartment for the 5 years. The girl named her dog same name as mc so that she can keep calling mc\u2019s name everyday. So as fate would have it, he visited the partment on that day due to nostalgia, and she happens to bring her dog out. Her dog ran away from her towards mc, and she called out mc\u2019s name to stop it, and it stops mc in his track. That caused the both of them to see each other again finally. So we can assume that they will get together after that."},{"id":1724035,"gallery_id":358058,"poster":{"id":2508614,"username":"Itiscool","slug":"itiscool","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1620422720,"body":"I\u2019m so confused on the ending "}]
