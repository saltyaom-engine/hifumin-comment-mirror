This one ends in a more positive no because it becomes consensual wall in the other he just uses that power of His to make the guy now girl fall in love with him in a love-hate relationship where she hates him for ruining her family and her childhood friend but can't resist mating with him. Love the subversion where he was never in love with his tomboy friend so there was no NTR. Especially when said a friend even corrupted still want to have sex with him simply out of a sense of entitlement to his virginity before the bombshell that he was never interested sexually in her no matter her body type or disposition LOL. I mean at least they're still good friends without the awkwardness now"},{"id":2324528,"gallery_id":385355,"poster":{"id":742482,"username":"Mabo","slug":"mabo","avatar_url":"avatars/742482.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1644524591,"body":"For what it's worth... it surprisingly ends on a positive note.
