The artist, Matsuo, and the group, Pureslider, are the originators of this great dj.  It's their hard work and great talent and skill that produced this."},{"id":786783,"gallery_id":256708,"poster":{"id":19905,"username":"raindragon","slug":"raindragon","avatar_url":"avatars/19905.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1547439847,"body":"Hey, whoever put this out in Chinese, I don't mind if you use my art, but I would have appreciated it if you had given me, Raindragon, and Raindalee Translations, credit.   For myself, I did ALL of the work you used for this, so, you know, credit where credit is due.  As well, we are the ones who did the originals you worked from.  Also, if you had notified me, I could have loaned you our cleaned raws.  Yep, I am that nice.. All we ask is that you include our credits page at the back.  That's all.  I'm glad to see a Chinese version, but think about it, if someone retranslates your retranslation, they'll be using my work, and my credit will be lost in all the languages your version is retranslated to. Terrible, badly processed raws, too,  I take a lot of time doing my decensoring, cleaning, photo-processing, and typesetting. It kills me to think it will go out to other countries in the terrible shape it's in in Chinese. Give me contact info in this comment section &amp; we'll talk"}]
