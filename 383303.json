You can switch to English as soon as you go on the site so it shouldn't be hard to sign up. Then get the Kindle version, or the physical copy if you want.

To my knowledge, most artists have their own donation page, so if there's someone you want to support in particular, I can look for them if you want."},{"id":2247833,"gallery_id":383303,"poster":{"id":4420945,"username":"GojoSatoru1","slug":"gojosatoru1","avatar_url":"avatars/4420945.png?_=ead71689eeb8582b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641522622,"body":"If only I could buy this...
