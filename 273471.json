But if you want context the source material is basically a zombie apocalypse involving a bunch of junior high girls and it focuses more on their psychological state (one is guilt ridden about their little sisters death that they get schizophrenia and ones delusional cus she snapped after seeing her dead classmates)."},{"id":917274,"gallery_id":273471,"poster":{"id":1189119,"username":"flipflappers17","slug":"flipflappers17","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1558890823,"body":"This is nice work.
