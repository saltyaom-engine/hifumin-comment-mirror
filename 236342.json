In which it is said, during a heated argument with Pythagoras himself over the perceived ratio of his theorem on pi she shouted \"But do it give the feeling very well!? Huh!? I'll fuck you up west side style yo!\". She lost this argument as Big P pulled out his 45., leading to most of her work and life being wiped from the annals of history, but I think she won morally at least.\n\nEven art itself is protected by the definition it has, this definition being \"Does it give the feeling very well?\"\n\nOne cannot call 'retarded' or 'moronic' things which one does not understand, after all it do give the feeling very well.\n\n*Sips tea in british*"},{"id":555611,"gallery_id":236342,"poster":{"id":1121685,"username":"jefferson77","slug":"jefferson77","avatar_url":"avatars/1121685.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1529674288,"body":"holy shit we need a fast translation for this one"},{"id":550216,"gallery_id":236342,"poster":{"id":237705,"username":"Metroid old account","slug":"metroid-old-account","avatar_url":"avatars/237705.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1529105299,"body":"skotein\u00f3s is a retarded moron"},{"id":549638,"gallery_id":236342,"poster":{"id":1765474,"username":"Skotein\u00f3s","slug":"skoteinos","avatar_url":"avatars/1765474.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1529025070,"body":"Dude your jobs are fuckkking ammmazing but i wish they could be english.
