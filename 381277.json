The script makes no sense what so ever. So I'm guess it's on Fuuga's side then and not a deficiency on your translating? Just the whole flow is off. First their kids and the murder a seemingly big deal they meet a guy and for some reason go to his apartment and THEN the brother attacks him out of nowhere. Time skip 10 years and both sibs are emotionless with mom dead and this whole bit about their moms brother but also their dads brother just thrown about. She makes advance to the guy they met, then just as easily decides to get him married to a girl in her class because the guy saw her pee? A girl who by the way seems on the edge of Yandere herself. Even if this was the setup first chapter there had to be a better to conveyed the plot than this miss mash of details. I was too confused to get a boner during the ONLY lack luster sex scene in a 50 page FIRST chapter.
