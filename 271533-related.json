So the manga takes advantage of this for its plot I guess. Also, it IS kind of rapey, but at the same time it's not, due to both girls ending up liking the guy.

What kind of a job lets a guy wash the bodies of females? Also, the MC is a molester and rapist. He molests and rapes these girls and they're OK with it. The orange haired girl seems to like the MC, but it's still molesting and rape. Also, the magic of hentai; the guy cums inside raw every time but the girls don't get pregnant unless the author says so. Unrealistic.\n\nArt is good, the girls are cute as hell and the sex scenes are drawn well. Unfortunately, the story and characters are trash.
