They definitely just called the plot bad before even reading it. I don't understand why they even feel the need to provide their take on a work that they didn't even understand. Tastes aside, that just doesn't make sense. Anyway, I think this \"MC discovering the secret relationship of his crush\" kinda falls into NTR, or at the very least I've seen works that gets the tag for it. But yes, this definitely has no shreds of cheating."},{"id":2094007,"gallery_id":375212,"poster":{"id":198609,"username":"donkeybringer","slug":"donkeybringer","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634752361,"body":"lol no one understand Japanese and all pretended to know the plot.
