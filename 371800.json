But the fact that she's been complimented as a woman (must be quite a personal thing for her) made her heart flutter perhaps. The Stockholm syndrome is also a reasonable take, but she still has free will technically, not exactly captive, even if they're technically being held by the two. I think its more on manipulation but not completely, the aliens are keeping her for their greater gain as she has no choice but slowly you see this glimmer of budding \"romance\" forming between the two. Can't say its genuine fondness/liking, I think its just a small 'crush' type of thing. Because come on, wouldn't it be nice to hear someone compliment on your insecurities and say that it shouldn't matter because you're still pretty and all?"},{"id":2000008,"gallery_id":371800,"poster":{"id":2230542,"username":"Ankylord","slug":"ankylord","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1630989616,"body":"Ok, now i hope she ends up with demon dude"},{"id":1999644,"gallery_id":371800,"poster":{"id":2564825,"username":"BZo1480","slug":"bzo1480","avatar_url":"avatars/2564825.png?_=3ff4cbfcb1167fd4","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1630978004,"body":"@ImTired It's manipulation.
