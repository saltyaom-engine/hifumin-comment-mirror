But then a friend of mine went to study in japan and she joined the tennis club and yeah all the kohai's had to go and watch the senpai's games and cheer for them. Didn't matter that it was during a weekend or that they would have to pay travel expenses and even living expenses if it was far away out of their own pockets. When she said that no she didn't wanna pay like 200 $ and spend her weekend to go cheer for the senpai's she almost got kicked out of the tennis club for being a bad kohai. This would have never been okey where I am from but from my understanding it's a big thing with senpai - kohai, sensei - students, boss - employee and so on that forces the lower ranked person to pretty much do whatever the person above them asks for a lot of the time."},{"id":2023938,"gallery_id":300951,"poster":{"id":2603637,"username":"LoveASS&sex$03476","slug":"loveass-sex-03476","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1631950405,"body":"Twitter @Pondeomaru"},{"id":1943233,"gallery_id":300951,"poster":{"id":4356039,"username":"MuXuanYin","slug":"muxuanyin","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1628895351,"body":"Lol just in Asia the Big shots make they\u2019re people wives bitchesi guess xd just there they make the wives pay with they\u2019re bodies the mistakes of they\u2019re hubbies"},{"id":1322393,"gallery_id":300951,"poster":{"id":3503528,"username":"Ary369","slug":"ary369","avatar_url":"avatars/3503528.png?_=99e71ea342c6801b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1604798036,"body":"We need more chapter"}]
