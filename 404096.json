She likes to change boyfriends, and having sex (that doesn't even feel that good and not like she really love them), but it's all because she's looking for a happy feeling she had experienced before. She found the closest to it are love and sex. It's only later, when Aoi helped her from the guys, she remembered. She first felt that feeling when Aoi stand up for her against their relatives. She might forgotten, but she's still searching for it. Well, she still tries to deny she had fell in love to her brother all along and look for his replacement. In the end, he told her they're not actually related (she's adopted), but she didn't take it seriously. She still go out with her boyfriends, but keep talking about brother during the whole date.
