Not that it was all bad, but it didn't feel like a proper Fallout game. At least Far Harbor and Nuka-world were good DLC but all the settlement stuff was garbage. I can't believe there's an actual Japanese crowd that enjoys the game. I just hope they've also played the older ones back when the series was at the height of it's glory with Fallout NV, Fallout 3 or even Fallout 2 and Fallout. "}]
