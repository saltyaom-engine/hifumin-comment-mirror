While it's true that we all make mistakes and should learn from them, it isn't demonstrated that she learned anything from her mistakes. She suffered zero consequences and everything ended up good for her. For all we know, she'll end up cheating again with zero pushback like she did with the other guy. She had all the reason and incentive to get back together with the black hair guy with glasses because she was literally rock bottom and he picked her up from her own filth, so that isn't a demonstration of her learning from her mistakes. She's a shitty person who did a shitty thing, AND we don't even know if she's changed due to lack of evidence.
