Personally I found Daily Lives of High School Boys to be the funniest anime ever but Nichijou is definitely among the best of the best. Some other top comedy anime and manga are the Grand Blue manga, the D-Frag manga (the anime was bad. don't watch it.), and most of Sabagebu which was the funniest shit ever 80% of the time and one of the worst anime I've ever seen for the remaining 20%."},{"id":2628909,"gallery_id":409895,"poster":{"id":48419,"username":"Sussy Paimon(?)","slug":"sussy-paimon","avatar_url":"avatars/48419.png?_=76517dcfe62066c9","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657183246,"body":"Nah but really  this was literally the greatest comedy to ever exist  anime wise\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d"}]
