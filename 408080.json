Miyako (the black haired girl) and her boyfriend Haruki got request from her best friend Kana to do swapping. Kana\u2019s relationship hasn\u2019t been going well lately and she\u2019s desperate to keep it from falling apart to suggest swapping. Kana has been Miyako\u2019s first and best friend, she also introduced Haruki, her childhood friend who is now Miyako\u2019s boyfriend. Yuuya, Kana\u2019s boyfriend, helped Miyako to get her first orgasm. Miyako always worried about being frigid because sex never felt good, neither does masturbating. After the swapping, Yuuya left his number to Miyako.| Seeing Kana did have it with Haruki, it\u2019s probably compatibility rather than Haruki being the typical NTR small dick boy. Want to see the relationship gets complicated if there are sequel, like how they start to grow fond of the other\u2019s partner more (for example, Yuuya also enjoys sex with Miyako more, and Kana being actually interested in Haruki)."}]
