Umi loves Kotori, but omega can't become pair, because they're too weak to protect themselves. So, Umi asked Maki (probably an alpha) to make her stronger (change her into alpha). The result is she became futanari, but still gets into heat like omega. There are people who don't like what Maki did, because it's threatening the structure of their world. Umi protects Maki, and Maki helps doing after care, at least that's the excuse.
