After he moves to Hokkaido, he's overcome with guilt for leaving Mayu without having said anything. The sex scene in this one is just a dream he has where he resents himself over having played with her feelings. The ending shows him having resolved himself to go see Mayu, even if it makes her hate him and shows Mayu who has just arrived at his new house, being greeted by his foster dad.
