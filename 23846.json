Huh? This isn't some doujin or something, this IS La Blue Girl, the original. The anime was made after the manga. Oh well, I guess the tag system on this site only has one way of labeling something as part of a series, and that's why it's always called \"parody\". Anyway, nice to see this classic here. "}]
