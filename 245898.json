She\u2019s seen visiting somebody\u2019s house, but he turns her away due to her outfit. The boy, an orphan living alone, asks her to come to house and asks for various favors like food and chores, which he couldn\u2019t do alone.  The boy then grows up, and has become self-sufficient, farming and declining her offer of instantly hunting meat, saying his own rice would suffice.  She then says she was going to depart to do good deeds elsewhere, and says whether he has one last wish, pressing him when he hesitates. He replies that he would like to have a child between him and the dark elf, to which she agrees after some surprise. It\u2019s the first time for both of them, and they confess love to each other. 70 years later, she\u2019s at his grave for a final farewell, leaving with their two children for her original quest of doing good deeds."},{"id":735905,"gallery_id":245898,"poster":{"id":30317,"username":"est430","slug":"est430","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1542515166,"body":"@m1ch43l grave of the guy she had sex and lived with, i mean, you know the difference of elfs and humans lifespan.
