I was going to stop and spit on it when Isby said his last death wish, but I'm happy I still had a little hope for a situation change, which happened. Because many doujins on this site betrayed humanity whether men or women and I won't call these trash and shit because I would be insulting garbage and excrements. And for the absolute better, that guy didn't care about Isby's death wish and I like that because otherwise it would be betrayal to humanity and siding with monsters. Also he got his power, heheehehhe and can shape-shift form that means that he can also get in a futa form where he would have a mix of his appearance, the two daughter's and his \"gf\" added to his appearance. What better ending would there be. Not forgetting that there's also the power steal which he obtained.
