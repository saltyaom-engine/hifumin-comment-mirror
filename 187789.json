Some of the persona 5 Doujinshi  I have read go over some major plot points (Futaba's existence is one of them). Other than that this is a good doujin (Igor is the best waifu there is anyway...)."},{"id":867239,"gallery_id":187789,"poster":{"id":1980911,"username":"YuriKinnie","slug":"yurikinnie","avatar_url":"avatars/1980911.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1554601324,"body":"This is the cutest thing I've ever seen."},{"id":682245,"gallery_id":187789,"poster":{"id":1921334,"username":"thatonegirlwhoreadsporn","slug":"thatonegirlwhoreadsporn","avatar_url":"avatars/1921334.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1536540104,"body":"Dude got chicken pox at the bottom page 13 lmao"},{"id":111323,"gallery_id":187789,"poster":{"id":212591,"username":"rjhan","slug":"rjhan","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1492418431,"body":"wow this comic made futaba so fucking cute~!"},{"id":97156,"gallery_id":187789,"poster":{"id":302098,"username":"assfield","slug":"assfield","avatar_url":"avatars/302098.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1488869853,"body":"I should have been playing this game by now."},{"id":92201,"gallery_id":187789,"poster":{"id":966847,"username":"talshiar40","slug":"talshiar40","avatar_url":"avatars/966847.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1487068394,"body":"Any real woman finding said notebook would kick his ass IRL.
