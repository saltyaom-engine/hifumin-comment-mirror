From what I've gathered, this is a story about a decent guy meeting our FMC who has some sort of past (widowed?) and couldn't move on until she met MC by chance. Throughout the story, it was mostly about FMC trying to move on, finally overcoming it at the end and found happiness. Disclaimer: this is just my opinion, I might be wrong but yea. This one definitely needs a TL, it would be a great read."},{"id":2144606,"gallery_id":380233,"poster":{"id":996591,"username":"heavenwing","slug":"heavenwing","avatar_url":"avatars/996591.png?_=93234bf013c7dfa1","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1636974428,"body":"No tomboy or tsundere tags"}]
