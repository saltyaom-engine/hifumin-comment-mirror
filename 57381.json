The adrenaline must have gotten to them, because they're using massive amounts of countersteer and angle. Not only is that slower than a proper all wheel drift, but it totally kills the tires. These drivers must only have a few hundred hours behind the wheel. Make better use of the brakes to initiate a drift on the hairpins, make sure all the tires are skidding including the front ones, and aim for maybe a 50\u00b0 angle through the corners. That's more along the lines of speed drifting. They're definitely fast enough to challenge most street racers, but their technique is just for show, especially compared to any driver with more time behind the wheel. They'd be dusted by anyone that's been seriously driving for a few months"},{"id":729627,"gallery_id":57381,"poster":{"id":1249160,"username":"vicker22","slug":"vicker22","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1541773958,"body":"Lancia stratos to be precise"},{"id":100729,"gallery_id":57381,"poster":{"id":1047117,"username":"maxi4492","slug":"maxi4492","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1490142466,"body":"Is that a Lancia?"}]
