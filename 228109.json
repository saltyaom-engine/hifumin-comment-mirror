I'm sure I'm not Japanese. But it was easier this time around because when translating the second part, I became immensely familiar with Japanese characters and Kanji. And my years of watching hentai already made me familiar with Japanese phrases. The story is that Kyouko received a phone call from her sister, and during this phone call, she and sister reminisce about the last year. During this conversation, Kyouko's sister is going through the events of the last year which from her perspective are seemingly innocent. For Kyouko however, the conversation is riddled with innuendo. (You can tell with some her responses where she slightly stutters.) The conversation is filled with double meanings--like the reason Kouhei would wake early in the morning, her cleaning up everyday, and her tutoring him, while the panels gave us the real reason.

Part of this doujinshi's appeal is as you mentioned, the \"escalation,\" which I think these hentai sites should really consider making a tag. It's the build up in that the situation starts with smaller indiscretions (i.e. starting with a handjob, then a blowjob.) And then when you think it couldn't get more nuanced they build up from emotionless \"humping\" to all-out sex with facials, cumming in between her tits, and pretty much marking her entire body with his spunk. I also like her conceived personality: she's a bit aloof, nonchalant, stoic, and mostly passive, making her go along with any sexual request her nephew has. (She also has a tomboyish demeanor which bolsters her sex appeal.) And there are subtle and overt hints which indicate that she was into the sexual relationship between herself and her nephew in parts 1 and 2. This really is a great doujinshi.
