I'd probably identify 2 parts to the cause. The first, would be how the mc has been \"left behind\" and has become a sort of outcast, which on its own, isn't a huge problem, which leads us to the second part.  The second part would be Otoha pretending to be a child to \"give him a place to belong\", but by deceiving him, reality hit him harder when it's all revealed, and really drove home the fact that he's the only one who hasn't changed, and the only one who hasn't moved on in life. There's also the part where she has no real intention of helping him, and seems to love him the way he is. Which, well, includes the trait that is commonly perceived as a flaw: immaturity, which I could go on another tangent about. Honestly, it didn't really hit me all that hard until I saw the mc's final thoughts. But I agree that this could have hit a lot harder with some more backstory.
