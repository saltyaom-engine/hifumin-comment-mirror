I felt we could have used a little less of Miharu's scenes with Makoto and maybe some other scenes to cut down on the length, but it was forgivable, I guess that's just me despising Makoto as a character and just wanting to get the why's of their actions. Either way, I had blast reading this as a story and some good fap material. A lot of the times, the dialogue left much to be desired for, but I guess I give it to Tsuya for trying to use the characters expressions to tell us all we need to know, and not have every little thing said, because it did feel a bit confusing at times, but a 2nd time reading it helped me understand the character motivations better, I did not like or agree with them, but I understood them and I am just glad to have a happy ending between Miharu and Masaki.

And besides, Masaki was still able to get some girls with him as well so it wasn't like he was never winning, it just made the ending more satisfying once he was able to win over his mom completely. He was still getting action in between, almost like appetizers before the main course.

And like @King_Galahad said, the NTR was used to drive the story, and not some fetish or kink just placed in. Sakaki was not big dick wins over woman, it was a mix of sexual and emotional manipulation, and Masaki was the one to fulfill his mother in both body, mind, and soul. Masaki loved her regardless, and like he said, Sakaki was incapable of loving anyone. Then we Midori coming in with undercover detective work of getting her husband turned in for illegal possession of drugs, what a power move, just loved how the characters all had a role in the story and did something significant. \n"},{"id":1706034,"gallery_id":30783,"poster":{"id":2746968,"username":"bbdo","slug":"bbdo","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1619672777,"body":"Although the incest was never truly at the forefront of the story like a kink or fetish, but more so as a drive for story and was actually introduced subtly in the background from a strong love that Masaki and Miharu felt for each other after her husband left into something more and was further realized when Masaki started going out with girls, Miharu felt that she needed to be with someone else, almost like her son, same as for him going out with older women like his mom. Since volume 1, we see Masaki being conscious of his mom as a woman, and soon after coming to the house, she became conscious of her son as a man. It was not clear exactly at one point when they realized their feelings for each other, besides this chapter when they had sex, but it did feel a little strange when they showed tendencies but not explained."},{"id":1706028,"gallery_id":30783,"poster":{"id":2746968,"username":"bbdo","slug":"bbdo","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1619672529,"body":"Then we have Midori reminding Masaki that he was the only who could save his mother from Sakaki, because he already saved her once as a child when Midori went looking for her to kill her for the love affair. That was really beautiful and how Masaki gave his mother the time she needed to end things with Sakaki, thus saving herself in the long run. With this in his heart, Masaki revealed to his mom in the shower and the bedroom, that regardless of all that has happened, and no matter how defiled she may feel, she is the most important person in Masaki's life, ever since he was little, after his father left, all throughout school, even through all the depravity, he knew that his mother just wanted to be accepted wholeheartedly in body and heart.

The icing on the whole encounter was Masaki punching Makoto across the hallway and making him realize he never truly loved her, nor even knew her. Spectacular performance! Then with Masaki coming in with the blanket to cover and comfort her, was truly the move to make in said situation.

What a roller coaster of a story this was! I was really impressed with how Tsuya reflected Makoto's rejection with Masaki's rejection back in volume 2 when she pushed him away as he came, realizing that it's over. I do have to say though I wonder why Masaki waited until Miharu rejected Makoto's advances towards the end, but I do feel it was necessary for him to understand that things were over between them. Makoto truly only ever saw Miharu as an object to conquer for his own pleasure of owning his friend's mother, like some sick contest and never actually cared for who she was or her past. He never gave a choice to explain when all the lies came out and just punished her with physical abuse.
