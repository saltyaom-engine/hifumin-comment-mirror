When I watch hentai, I need to at least three things to consider it good. A good story, to feel engrossed into the work. A good art, to fully appreciate how much work the author put into it. And a feeling that this is what the author wanted to do. I need to feel the passion put into each work that makes it so special for the one that made it, and for the one that reads it. Unfortunately, the emptiness transmitted by the white color doesn't really makes me feel anything other than emptiness too. That is why colors are important.\n1/10."}]
