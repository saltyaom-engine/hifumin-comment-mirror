So they all alliance on shitting on these kind of story with this Tag. Just like the sad excuse of a plot of this particular one. Sidenote im a Part-time NTR-Fag, but still this plot is just fucking sad.

Also, Haruka is a POS of a MC. Chars like Ryouhei should've been the MC to benefit a harem like this and including Sora. Why should Haruka get to benefit in getting his sister after fooling around with other girls besides Sora? I mean maybe consider the fact that this is one of the routes where he pursued other girls and Sora is left behind? At least Ryouhei in all routes was consistent in being interested in Sora. He's the one who deserves her, not POS Haruka. But ofc that doesn't serve your selfish wants/needs huh? Hypocritical/double standardizing vanilla fucks like you should gfto.
