The MC reincarnated as Lilia, the villainess, but she doesn't like the overly perfect crown prince Maser. Instead the man she love is her childhood friend Martin, who is just a background character. She tried coupling Maser with Alice the heroine and gets her engagement annulled. Maser never really likes Lilia anyway, so she's optimistic enough to tell she had someone else, a commoner, she loves. Her biggest misstep is when she nodded when Maser joked he's so stressed by job, he might burns down a village. Maser, whose magic accidentally massacred his servants, is feared. Even when he killed gardener who jacked off at him, all witness pretend they see nothing. Lilia became special to him, someone he won't let go. He even burns a neighbouring village as example after even 1 month non-stop raping hasn't broke her. BTW, Maser's brother is tsundere to Lilia, he even guarded his virginity for her, but he always looks like he hates her.
