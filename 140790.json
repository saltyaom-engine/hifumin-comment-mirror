So when i see something like on page 2 were he says \"you want me to scrape your hungry pussy\" it always looks weird af. the correct word one should use in that sentence would be rub or fuck but scrape isn't right. Not much point in writing this here but I wanted to say my piece."},{"id":1556294,"gallery_id":140790,"poster":{"id":3949064,"username":"AstolfoForPresident","slug":"astolfoforpresident","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1612930555,"body":"The bean council approves.
