So instead this fucking cat speaks for you. However, he isn't a good character. In my case, all of his decisions were either the most obvious thing to do or something that I would never do but was forced to do regardless because the cat said so. World had a similar problem with the Handler in that she often speaks for you, but she doesn't follow during every single move you make and there are plenty of other characters that give you quests and tasks. I hated almost every character in Stories and I don't remember most of them. In the end, I haven't touched MH Stories in almost a year and I probably won't pick it up again. Not only because of the terrible characters but of the too simplistic gameplay. MH Stories was fun but ultimately disappointing.

That motherfucking cat! This abomination and pathetic attempt and humor relief tortured my every moment of playing Monster Hunter Stories! I didn't realize it at this first, but he brought nothing but misery and despair. I'm not joking, every single move in battle, hey just has to open his fucking horrible mouth and say something obvious about what just happened. I know my Zinogre just used a technique move that loses against the enemy's Rathalos's technique power move. I fucking know my Gold Rathian is low on health. I fucking know I won the battle! Is this comment getting repetitive? Imagine that for almost 80+ hours that I sunk into that game watching this cunty cat talk the entire time.
