Needless to say, the titular protagonist, according to @Luke Atemey is a strongest female main character up to date.

And the female lead is one (if not) the strongest main character I've seen on recent anime. The first three if not four episodes will turn people off but if you could just stick with it till the end, it's well worth it. Trust me."}]
