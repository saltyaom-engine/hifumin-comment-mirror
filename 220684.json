The guy likes schoolgirls very much according to the prequel, in fact he likes them so much he robs banks in order to keep seeing them, this explains why he is getting more scars between chapters and the reason why he never took his shirt off this chapter due to having a fresh wound. \nseeing how shiwasu no okina write in his older works, the guy will probably get caught leading to some kind of emotional reveal, and would probably also lead to copious amount of hot sex."},{"id":350826,"gallery_id":220684,"poster":{"id":137274,"username":"jimtel","slug":"jimtel","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1516072382,"body":"borrowed all the money? cant pay it back?
