The husband pays for the other girl\u2019s debts and releases her rather than his wife. She\u2019s happy and can\u2019t wait to leave the place behind and is shattered by the revelation. I\u2019m assuming he leaves her behind and goes with the other girl. The first 3/4 of the story looks like he\u2019s always fucking up some way or other. Looks like debts, marriage against parents\u2019 will etc. I\u2019m not sure cause I didn\u2019t translate that part."}]
