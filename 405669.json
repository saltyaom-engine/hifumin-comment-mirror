I hate the fact that this is linked to the original Retake, it had a perfect ending, there is no need to shit all over with it with this sequel, Hot take but i think a new Retake should have focus on a new girl, make Retake Kai about either Rei or Mari, asuka story was resolved with the original Retake."},{"id":2571736,"gallery_id":405669,"poster":{"id":3020007,"username":"agehabeach12","slug":"agehabeach12","avatar_url":"avatars/3020007.png?_=9b8958dd603ff598","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1654462559,"body":"(\u0ca0_\u0ca0) Asushin niggas really be wilin sometimes"},{"id":2570310,"gallery_id":405669,"poster":{"id":3358169,"username":"Feuerteufel","slug":"feuerteufel","avatar_url":"avatars/3358169.png?_=e59dd767624caeb1","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1654394322,"body":"Selfcest best -cest. Also very nice work. Studio Kimigabuchi remains as a titan of serious Doujin-storytelling. Wish more artist would do so, afterall not only the dick but also brain and heart are in need for some satisfaction from time to time."}]
