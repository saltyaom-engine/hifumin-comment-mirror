This started with me just wanting to practice my japanese, so that I'd be able to practically apply what I've learned over the years. (and also to avoid getting rusty from lack of practice.) And a lot of my solo projects have really just been me attempting to test myself and really learn new skills or to help me get better or make my processes faster. Which is why my editing skills have gotten better recently as well. So, all in all, it's just something I'm doing for fun on the side. I can rush more jobs but then I feel like the quality would drop, and I don't want that.

It'll vary based on how much text there is to translate and then typeset, and how much editing/cleaning/redrawing I'll need to do as well. Without rushing, I usually do around 15-25 pages a day. This project, for example, took about a day from start to finish. I can do more, but I choose not to so I avoid burn out. Since I'm working entirely solo, I have a lot of freedom around my timings and I can rotate between multiple projects as well. The downside is that I'm working entirely solo, so if I run into a job that, for example, takes a lot of editing/redrawing then it'll hold up other parts of the process. That's why I understand why some people prefer to work in groups. They can split the work and do a lot more a lot faster. But I happen to like the freedom and flexibility I have on my own, since I'm not holding up or being held up by the redrawer working on a panel or the typesetting working on a page, or something like that.
