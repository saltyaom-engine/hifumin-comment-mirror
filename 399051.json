Was the one who worked on the last crimson book(The Hinata one at the library). Finished translating and typesetting this around a month ago with the help of machine translation, so the translations might not be on par with others. Still taking classes to get my N4. Wasn't gonna upload this because I wanted to wait for Kizlan's version since he's a top-tier translator but it seems like he probably won't work on crimson anytime soon. He already did Kaguya Humiliation but was forced to take it down and even if I have the file, I won't uploaded it, in respect to him. \n\nSince this was my 2nd book, I fiddled more with the fonts and typesetting. Maybe a bit of redrawing, only on pattern-like backgrounds with the clone tool. I think this one turned out a lot better than last time.\n\nI might work on the recent Sayuki soon but I'm not gonna rush it. I really love the Kaguya series so I'll probably translate them whenever they come out.
