Don\u2019t justify it like it\u2018s some crusade. Quite frankly, if crimson would work with a publishing team to release her works in English at the same time as the Japanese I would gladly pay for them. $10 for work isn\u2019t that much, I don\u2019t buy every work anyway.  I translate, put in the work, and upload it because I wanted to, and I can easily just not do it if I don\u2019t feel like it. I got a couple of comments like these on e-hentai, and it pisses me off because there are people who feel entitled when they got something for free.  I\u2019m considering doing other crimson works soon but if I continue to get entitled comments like these, I\u2019ll just keep it for myself. I don\u2019t owe you anything, I paid for my own raws, I study Japanese and I did my own typesetting. Go do your own shit if you think I\u2019m hoarding."},{"id":2470137,"gallery_id":399051,"poster":{"id":1824974,"username":"LewdBoiSteve","slug":"lewdboisteve","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1650416274,"body":"Fuck the credit, fuck the honor, fuck doing what you think is a favor to other people you respect. The scantilator of this title should go ahead and reupload the prequel. Idori is going to slash and burn anything they can, and being a nice guy to other scene members isn't going to keep the work in circulation. That means Idori wins.\n\nThe most important part is that the media stays in circulation. Stop hoarding hentai scans/translations in their source (raw) quality. The downstream grifters are going to butcher the resolution and slap dozens of watermarks on the work anyway. So this sort of attitude really only hurts the people that are the most fanatic about their collections.

Was the one who worked on the last crimson book(The Hinata one at the library). Finished translating and typesetting this around a month ago with the help of machine translation, so the translations might not be on par with others. Still taking classes to get my N4. Wasn't gonna upload this because I wanted to wait for Kizlan's version since he's a top-tier translator but it seems like he probably won't work on crimson anytime soon. He already did Kaguya Humiliation but was forced to take it down and even if I have the file, I won't uploaded it, in respect to him. \n\nSince this was my 2nd book, I fiddled more with the fonts and typesetting. Maybe a bit of redrawing, only on pattern-like backgrounds with the clone tool. I think this one turned out a lot better than last time.\n\nI might work on the recent Sayuki soon but I'm not gonna rush it. I really love the Kaguya series so I'll probably translate them whenever they come out. "}]
