In almost every NTR doujinshi, they never fight back and in some cases encourage their women to be violated by other men. I read somewhere that women in Japan are becoming more assertive and in a traditionally conservative society, men don't know how to handle it and thus aren't as compatible with their women anymore. I don't know ANYONE in real life that would ever let this happen. Cheating? Sure, but the shit that goes on in these comics? Never. "}]
