It captures the mood and feel of Tekken 3 nicely and it even gives a decent send off to Michelle Chang since Julia replaces her here. Jin being treated in such a silly manner is stupid but the drawings of Xiaoyu are the real gem of this doujin for sure. She looks so great in her bloomers and he got her proportions just perfect. This may not be something I'd really fap to a lot but just something to really appreciate the art of more than anything else honestly.  "}]
