With that kind of MC? Keep dreaming. Do you know why there's more Netorare than Netori right now? It's because of the current trend of anime where it's nothing but beta cuck herbivore fucbois for MCs. Especially in harem ecchi animes. Sadly, those kinds of tropes are made as the MC for a reason. Even if it's a pathetic one. NTR just levels the playing field.
