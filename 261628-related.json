From a previous comment by Eltole, he planned to write Milt to get knocked up with 2nd child while escaping perhaps with Raleigh by coincidence. Eltole knew that story wasn't pushing forward the way he wanted to so he might try to get it moving forward a bit. I just hope for a decent ending for Milt man...
