I scroll down on the first page, expecting to see many different characters, but one catches my eye. It's Professor Layton! My mind is filled with questions, and I let my curiosity get the better of me. I read the story, and head back to the front page afterwords, thinking it was all over. This was until I noticed that the front page was filled with different Professor Layton stories. I started at my screen in confusion. \"What?\" I say as more questions fill me brain, \"Who is responsible for this?\" I look at each artist's name and find that each story is by a different one. I could not believe that it was a group of people, all having Layton stories on the front page at once! What had happened to humanity? We have strayed so far from god, that now, I fear we cannot go back.
