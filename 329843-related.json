But the details, the objects, the lighting/gleam making it feels like not just the cover was colored, but the whole thing, only that of course, it would be so much more expensive to have the entire thing in color, which is possible, but would jack up the price. Heck, even the liquid and steam, this author has been good at this since all the way back with the \"Kaki Hoshuu\" series, pity that it ended(?) the way it did, but still good nonetheless."},{"id":1409311,"gallery_id":329843,"poster":{"id":3882772,"username":"AFMAN-79","slug":"afman-79","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1608090505,"body":"Not a fan of the Dilf/ugly bastard genre but the pacing and artwork is so good that it doesn\u2019t bother me.
