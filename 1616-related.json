They go a store and they look at the first chapter of a story, then it turns out to be wholesome sex between lovers. They buy it, bring it home and then read it but, when they turn to the next page, after reading the first chapter, they are met with a girl being fucked by a horse in the ass while giving birth. It is like playing Russian roulette with your sanity. It doesn't matter how many times you win, what really matters is how many rounds you can take before you finally lose.\n1/10."}]
