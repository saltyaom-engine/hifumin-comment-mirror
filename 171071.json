The motherfucking matchgirl story was fucking traumatizing as a kid, like holy shit. For whoever never heard or read it, it basically goes like this: The girl is selling matches in the freezing cold either on Christmas eve or New Years' eve, she can't go home because abusive father, so she keeps at it but no one is buying matches from her so she starts burning one after another for just a little bit of warmth. After a bit, hypothermia kicks in and she starts having visions of warmth and the lights of a christmas tree while she slowly succumbs to the biting cold she can no longer feel. After she dies her dead grandmother takes her soul to heaven where they are finally happy together. Like holy fuck was that shit sad and terrifying when I was a kid, and now I find fucking porn of it, like goddamn."}]
