I read through Alice ejecting sausages through her ass like WTF\u2026 scat is not my thing, but I majorly appreciate the accurate characterizations and working within the canonical plotline. Kudos to Miyabi for being a wild freak and a dedicated fan. But I just have to say how devastated I was when Nicolai left and was replaced by a gangbang of ugly soldiers. THAT WAS SUCH A TEASE!!! I love the premise of him turning Karin into his sex slave via the dream world\u2026 if only we could have seen that. T_T It also made me consider what an utter mindfuck it would have been if Nicolai canonically had sex with Karin, resulting in Karin already being impregnated when she returned to the past and rendering Nicolai to be Yuri\u2019s biological father. Impossible but fun to think about, lol\u2026"}]
