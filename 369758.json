The sex makes her really happy and she confesses her love. At the end shes just getting a bit of revenge but its clear they love eachother and that they're going to be together. Very wholesome with a happy ending."},{"id":1972716,"gallery_id":369758,"poster":{"id":2708402,"username":"CrazyRabbit","slug":"crazyrabbit","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629912980,"body":"Too \u751c              "},{"id":1957570,"gallery_id":369758,"poster":{"id":1400370,"username":"starfox1234","slug":"starfox1234","avatar_url":"avatars/1400370.png?_=8fe9415a33f35edc","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629370147,"body":"Needs some English"},{"id":1957149,"gallery_id":369758,"poster":{"id":2290461,"username":"\u65e5\u5bc4\u5b50","slug":"ri-ji-zi","avatar_url":"avatars/2290461.png?_=683c92bad1c32f64","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629352694,"body":"u right, she doesn't get hypnotized, all planned i think,"},{"id":1957089,"gallery_id":369758,"poster":{"id":3338098,"username":"The Pepsi In The Comments","slug":"the-pepsi-in-the-comments","avatar_url":"avatars/3338098.png?_=0327ea8d26a46ee0","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629349934,"body":"I\u2019m gonna assume that she wasn\u2019t really hypnotized, or she was, but it was too weak and snapped out of it near the end?
