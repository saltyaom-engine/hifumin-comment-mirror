It\u2019s not swinging, it\u2019s full NTR. She clear enjoys sex with the friend more, they have sex behind the boyfriends back, the friend lies to her, and his dick is twice the size of the boyfriends. She even says she loves him during sex. This is not swinging. She clearly likes the friend more. At least sexually. And that\u2019s really what makes NTR. and the whole birthday plot wasn\u2019t resolved? And we rarely see any boyfriend action. This is honestly not good. It\u2019s a stereotypical \u201cswinging\u201d hentai. If there ever is another chapter, I can almost guarantee she\u2019ll leave the boyfriend.

I was initially fine with this story, but the more I think about it the more I hate it and its inconclusiveness."},{"id":1661699,"gallery_id":321407,"poster":{"id":1571575,"username":"Aldyn","slug":"aldyn","avatar_url":"avatars/1571575.png?_=6b1988a6df0a01d5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1617634242,"body":"I think the last page where Rina talks in her sleep is adorable, but it's not enough to show that she's sexually SATISFIED with her boyfriend. He makes her cum, sure, but not as much as the other guy. On one hand I appreciate a swinging doujin that doesn't take itself seriously, but on the other it's frustrating how there is no conclusion and it feels like I just wasted my time waiting for an ending that never came, especially after everything that happened in Koibito Gokko 2. This girl cheated on her boyfriend because she thought he forgot about her birthday, trusted Kudou when he LIED about Shougo's surprise, allowed herself to be filmed, and even said that she loved Kudou multiple times. And what conclusion do we get? Nothing. She doesn't regret anything, doesn't face any consequences, doesn't tell Shougo what happened, and we don't even get to see how the whole birthday conflict ended. All we get is a plot vacuum between Koibito Gokko 2 and this, and everything is suddenly fine."},{"id":1661639,"gallery_id":321407,"poster":{"id":1571575,"username":"Aldyn","slug":"aldyn","avatar_url":"avatars/1571575.png?_=6b1988a6df0a01d5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1617632407,"body":"Even if the next chapter was canon, I don't think it matters. It doesn't show anything that we haven't seen before. But honestly, though, how did the MC \"get his girl back\"? The first chapter (Koibito Gokko, not this one) makes it clear that Kudou has a bigger dick, and even in this one he is the only one who's capable of making Rina cum so much that she loses all of her strength. And she doesn't \"clearly show that she doesn't want to have sex with him\" at any point. This is hentai. Girls will say \"No \u2661\" when they really mean yes. She could easily tell her boyfriend about it or just call the whole thing off, but she doesn't. She goes behind her boyfriend's back multiple times and doesn't show any signs of regret. Even swinging relationships have ground rules. If one party doesn't consent, it's cheating. So no, I don't think the author is just playing with our minds. This story as a whole is NTR. A lighthearted one, but still NTR nonetheless."},{"id":1209715,"gallery_id":321407,"poster":{"id":3623524,"username":"pettam4","slug":"pettam4","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1600066110,"body":"The start of this chap is an omake itself, anything that is sketched by the author is just alternate beginning/ending that fall from the main canon.

The bf friend likes having sex with her because she matches his sex drive more, shes just horny but not \"im gonna ditch my bf horny\"; she still loves him deeply even in the latest chp; shes worried that her bf ex is coming back, if she didnt care she wouldnt look and spy on her bf.
