Of course this could be because of multiple reasons like the wife having cheated, the woman might have had several partners but thinks/wants the child to be a specific mans child but never does a paternity test with most often the \"father\" never knowing there could be other potentials dads, there are also cases of men being sterile and the woman getting an insemination behind their backs or some other reasons.

Husband invites him to their room to thank him for taking \"care\" of his wife at work. Wife is a bit against it at first but quickly starts cheating on the husband, I think she complains at that he bragged to much about their daughter. When husband falls asleep drunk she directly starts cheating on him, then the husband murmers they should have a second child in his sleep. The coworker goes crazy with trying to impregnate her and the wife thinks this is bad and she shouldn't be doing this but her body wants it. Then it's pretty much the coworker cumming inside her over and over while the husband still drowsy goes to sleep next to them fucking. Will probably be a part 3 with her being pregnant with the coworkers child and the husband unaware that she's cheating on him all the time, or it's just strongly hinted here thats what happens."},{"id":1517477,"gallery_id":340658,"poster":{"id":3259977,"username":"hERObarreto","slug":"herobarreto","avatar_url":"avatars/3259977.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611235983,"body":"Misaoka  - 98\n"},{"id":1515131,"gallery_id":340658,"poster":{"id":229539,"username":"Mr. Brk","slug":"mr-brk","avatar_url":"avatars/229539.png?_=b9366f50660e25f0","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611131723,"body":"My god there is so many good artist!
