Her pulling him along the way she did in the beginning is suggesting she felt somewhat the same at that point(as this is the actions of any childhood friend that secretly loves her \"friend\" in any such story). People really need to stop thinking that NTR only pertains to actual couples...the genre has moved on to include POTENTIAL love interests of the MC, too...bonus points if the love interest also has feelings for the MC...or strongly implied.\n\nThat said, the NTR in this is light as MC moved on to another girl already...wish more NTR had this happen. Just wish there would have been another page of the childhood friend trying to pull him along again, only for his new girlfriend to bump her out of the way and take her place.
