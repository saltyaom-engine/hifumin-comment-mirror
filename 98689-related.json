The problem with this netorare (and many of them) is not that your main character are betrayed by his most important people (girlfriend, mother, dauther or wife), the problem is his lack of reaction. I know tha what i called problem it is something that represent netorare but i think it would be more enjoyable and with better stories if the main character react as someone normally do (with anger in most cases, violence or in some greater situation with a master plan for revenge, and i dont say that it has to be a hapy end or that he win in the end but at least that he tried)."},{"id":2824,"gallery_id":98689,"poster":{"id":56885,"username":"gonjile","slug":"gonjile","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1423173200,"body":"please eng translate"}]
