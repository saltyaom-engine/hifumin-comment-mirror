She goes to leave for work and he kisses her, says goodbye, and she's all flustered. Senpai also then goes out and is annoyed that Yohei's body is so popular with the girls he bumps into. Red haired Risa is waiting at their workplace to talk to Earu, and she says sorry she told Senpai about how Earu's living situation was bad, and how that caused Senpai to go to Earu's house. Earu did not know Senpai went to her house it seems, only that Yohei was in a bad accident. She says to friend not to worry, but page 22 ends with her muttering to herself \"hmm so Senpai came to my house when Risa told him to.\" pg 23, \"But when I called you for help (all those years ago), you just ignored me.\" Senpai goes to see his own body, still in coma.
