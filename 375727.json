Can't say anything about the dialogue, however. Technically, is mostly the same, so it shouldn't take long to see a colored/uncensored version of this remaster"},{"id":2075578,"gallery_id":375727,"poster":{"id":2612499,"username":"zferolie","slug":"zferolie","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1633975493,"body":"So, whats different with this remaster?
