Before the initial rape, she had been working at the shop for an entire month, so I assume she had already developed a decent relationshiip with Saori's husband, and since Saori and Kana were friends before the story started, she must have known about her husband before hand. This is different from a rape turned infidelity by a complete stranger, Kana already got to know this man for some time before he made his move. After the first incident, it is then shown that 2 months had passed before he attempted the same thing on her.

No poisonous conversation, no talk about broken trust, nothing? But I know what killed this story and made it so underwhelming. It was the fact that Kotaro also cheated on Kana. Page 105 is where this story killed itself, because the fact that he cheated on Kana makes her actions seem less shitty, but EVEN THEN it's still stupid, because Kotaro was drunk and cheated once while Kana was completely sober and kept going back to Naoki.

Kana reflecting on her choices towards the end and regaining her love for her husband, along with him regaining his love and trust for his wife, along with realizing that he wanted children, in spite of his economic situation, for the sake of having a fulfilling life and family with his wife! My full review is on the previous english upload of the story, but still have to say that it was one of the more satisfying stories I have read in this particular genre and gave us real characters with real and believable actions and reactions to their situations! Very good writing and intense ambiance and theme! Would love to see more of this author's stories translated."},{"id":1586938,"gallery_id":349247,"poster":{"id":2307963,"username":"Alsayer","slug":"alsayer","avatar_url":"avatars/2307963.png?_=a2d680e6ed8af394","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1614309736,"body":"this one is legit.
