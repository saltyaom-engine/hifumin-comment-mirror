From what I understand Sekito is/was the leader of a dragon killer group, but betrayed his group upon seeing Shuu, and saved her/tried to get rid of the poison that, I think his group poisoned her with, but I'm not sure about that. Does anybody else have a different/maybe better Interpretation, because I'm not sure if I read all of it right, and if I didn't overlook something really important. "}]
