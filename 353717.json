It's easy and they don't have to think of the \"story\" as the people that like it are easily appealed. Just give some good art and people to laugh at and hurt, it's a succes.\n\nFunny how when an artist who never made an ntr makes one and suddenly cucks fly in from everywhere to \"support\".

Defective people are everywhere sadly... "}]
