Guy got framed for a crime he didn't commit and his life ruined! And the worst thing was the chick completely forgot about it! Understandable because looking at it, it was long ago, but still fucked up since it looked like she did it for the laughs, and since no karma came her way for it (she got to marry the other guy and have kids) she never felt bad about it! Wouldn't be surprised if their sex life was dying at that point! Would be the corner stone of his revenge! Especially since they both likely forgot about him, assuming he's life ruined means he'd never get revenge! When living off the radar means even if the husband remembers. They'll never find him, and he'll never know unless he taunted him that his wife \"completely enjoyed getting fucked by what she saw as a stranger then her husband!\" Would suck if their kids found mommy in that state he left her in! Their \"perfect ending\" turned upside down cause the \"past came to collect!\""}]
