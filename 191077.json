When she got to the new version of the present (due to timeline shenanigans), she was suspicious of male Robin but he wasn't a chick and she let it be. She ended up catching feelings for him and by the time she realized that regardless of human gender: Grima is Grima, it was already too late. She had fallen in love with another version of her nemesis. Ouch! You could also flip the story to make it more tragic for FemRobin + Chrom. Lucina didn't realize her own mother was Grima because she was sure Grima could only be male. Now she realizes she has a direct bloodline to Grima and that in fact she is the heiress of Darkness. \n"},{"id":1943403,"gallery_id":191077,"poster":{"id":3683042,"username":"Dankest Lariat","slug":"dankest-lariat","avatar_url":"avatars/3683042.png?_=f0be87c9b48ad746","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1628900286,"body":"Me Gusta.

It is one of the dumbest things I've seen in all of Fire Emblem. (Fates as a whole is worse) It's ok at first when you don't pay attention to the story or characters at all, but it's awful when you do and put some logic in it. Why would Lucina fall in love with who she thought to be the enemy? If you're married to her before she confronts Robin, she falters which ruins the point of her own mission. If he's married to Lissa. Fuck them, I guess. She'd let her own aunt suffer the sadness and basically kill off Owain. If he's married to anyone else. \"Sorry my friend but your sacrifice is something I'm willing to make.\" On Robin's part, why would he fall in love with someone he has seen as a baby or someone that just tried to kill him? It's honestly retarded to think he would. In other words, fuck that pairing, it should have never existed.
