Way too many shipgirl doujins now. Real Navy girls don't wear skirts anyways. Anyways, I like loli stuff for sure but so sick of the bullshit Navy crap. There's just no originality in it anymore and so much rape and bbm content *gag*. Anyways over 7k kantai collection doujins is enough, it's time to move on. Oh and for loli anime, Black Bullet takes the cake, lots of canon loli shipping. So just to make sure I'm being clear, good doujin, but I'm sick of seeing the male ship captain w/ shipgirl combination."},{"id":140048,"gallery_id":184695,"poster":{"id":1239244,"username":"GuriChan","slug":"gurichan","avatar_url":"avatars/1239244.png?_=db5c92232d70e0e3","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1499940091,"body":"Kantai collection.
