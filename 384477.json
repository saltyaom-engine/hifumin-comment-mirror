For one the title makes you think dudes gonna have drama with the entire club when it's just him, nozomi and some random ass bootleg Hestia (danmachi). Secondly it seems to heavily rely on teasing but the problem being is that the teasing scenes are extremely generic, other doujins done em before and executed em better. The locker scene? Even stringendo does that shit better. The scenes with his girlfriend are super generic too, \"I'm gonna help you study when your home is conveniently empty!\" \"oh I wanna go to the mall to buy a swimsuit\" \"oh do I look cute in this swimsuit\" \"don't come in here b-baka!\" Get my point? The art is also kinda inconsistent but I can't really judge since I'm a starting out artist and this shit is hard to get right. Overall 3.9/10, alright material but there are so much better options that execute their plot more efficiently"},{"id":2210817,"gallery_id":384477,"poster":{"id":3894717,"username":"mailforporn","slug":"mailforporn","avatar_url":"avatars/3894717.png?_=e366df25822169ab","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640082817,"body":"it's actually all kinds of bad. its all just teasing until the last scene so its bad as porn, it's got a chekhov's gun girl for one scene that gets forgotten and ignored after that so its bad as story. its like someone planned a whole lot more and then gave up after two intro chapters."},{"id":2210372,"gallery_id":384477,"poster":{"id":4251174,"username":"Delete Account","slug":"delete-account","avatar_url":"avatars/4251174.png?_=5656371364c24e18","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640061252,"body":"U-huh... anyway smut's not so bad.
