It felt like a 30 chapters story shortened into 5. Characters looking similar to each other makes things even worse, in the final chapter I first thought the girl was his childhood friend. Overall a clusterfuck where there are pretty much  no likeable parties... the thing I gotta suggest to anyone reading is that relationship are made amazing just by communication alone, if you have a problem and you openly talk to your partner everything is going to be far greater that you might think, and if you see your partner having problems opening up try and talk to them and slowly make them open up, It will work wonders. Going back to the hentai, i like the drawings a lot but it's not the kind of art i would fap to (it's kinda weird but it also makes sense in my head)"},{"id":2549264,"gallery_id":402831,"poster":{"id":3367461,"username":"Panties in Black","slug":"panties-in-black","avatar_url":"avatars/3367461.png?_=7919c787774ba56f","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1653497735,"body":"Shit story great art.

Author had so many storylines and decided to salt the earth instead of wrap them up decently. Could have gone with childhood friend route but mf didn't.  Pretty unfortunate this had such a poor ending but it seems all parties were very unlikable in general. Mc was a cheating ass mf, childhood friend wasn't given a chance, mc gf was an insecure and picky, her best friend was a snake, so all in all this was bound for disaster. To top it off his new gf is sus as all hell so who even knows. Bottom line, go read something else if you want a better story. 4/10 sex scenes were decent but thats all there is to this.

He did cheat on her with two different women, so that's a clear indicator that he wasn't that good of a guy to begin with, but maybe he did not try using the lost earring as an excuste for a final chance meetup because he felt like punishing himself/couldn't look her in the eye anymore, but then again, he states that he ran to the childhood friend a couple of times afterward, so who knows. Also also, I think the massive scar was supposed to represent insecurites/hesitation from opening up to someone after being burned (pun I guess intended) before, and how all that artificial distance made the guy drift to other women. It shows that both parties are to be blamed for the breakup, even though one clearly bears a way more heavy burden here.
