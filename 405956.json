The trauma of the event caused Ran to block out any memory of him, which is why she gets short flashbacks about him. In the end, once she remembers everything, the lesson she learned was something akin to the value of human lives (the original Japanese has her say something to the effect of \"I've realized that humans are more than just cattle\").

The first two books are Ran remembering time spent with a human she was married to but also not remembering him very well, which is explained by the author as \"because humans have such short lifespans, a youkai that lives long like a kitsune is not going to remember them very well; that she remembers anything about him is testament to how strong an impression he made on her\". This book is one of the times they had sex but nothing more. This said, it gets confusing because YAMADA Airbase released an anthology with the whole story that recontextualized everything. Short of it is that Ran married a human that Yukari brought in to stay with them for a while (because of a gap in the Hakurei Barrier). Ran and her husband have a good time together, but once the gap closes Yukari orders Ran to kill him. Which she does and he accepts as his fate."},{"id":2574538,"gallery_id":405956,"poster":{"id":2584059,"username":"Vtwo","slug":"vtwo","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1654577647,"body":"Ran is smug XD"},{"id":2574262,"gallery_id":405956,"poster":{"id":2860487,"username":"In Case you Didn't Know","slug":"in-case-you-didn-t-know","avatar_url":"avatars/2860487.png?_=b4a420fece4c2bc1","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1654566932,"body":"Whole series is borderline femdon but no English translation for these man it sucks"}]
