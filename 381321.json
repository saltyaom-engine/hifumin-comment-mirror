Endou, the black shirt guy, is in part-time course. He doesn't know Kuroki (soccer club boy) is Makino's boyfriend until the classroom sex. It seems like Kuroki is the type of guy who are used to free sex, he's disappointed about how Makino still refuse having sex despite them going out for /a week/ already. After the movie date, Kuroki invites Makino to his home, with signal about having sex. Makino refused (because her panties are wet), and he invited Sasai, his sex friend. Makino still refuses Endou because she's Kuroki's girlfriend. That's until the infirmary sex, when she heard Sasai talks Kuroki about breaking up the girlfriend who wont give him sex. They break up, and Kuroki wants to date Sasai officially, only she already got another guy. That Sasai is a bomb. If the story continue, she'll definitely ruin Ono, the student council president. So, Kana is the lucky one to at least get a parachute before jumping out the burning plane."},{"id":2159994,"gallery_id":381321,"poster":{"id":2408988,"username":"Sgt.
