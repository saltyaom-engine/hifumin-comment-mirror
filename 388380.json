Especially the last part, there is just something so euphoric in volunteering maybe not even intimate, but very personal, mundane information. If I had to describe it for myself, it feels like stripping your very inner-being, forcibly pulling any layer that makes one a person. And this is so much worse (better) than simple exhibitionism - once every facet of you becomes public information, you cease being an induvidual (at least in the current setting); simply for the fact that you can no longer differentiate social ties - which are determined, at their very core, by how much someone knows about you. Conversely, the other side logically becomes polarized, and with such one sided interaction, in which one gives all while the other nothing, it is inevitable for one to start being treated as property. So remember fellas, it's not humanity that's evil, it's just basic philosophy!"},{"id":2277525,"gallery_id":388380,"poster":{"id":1323721,"username":"unit0ne","slug":"unit0ne","avatar_url":"avatars/1323721.png?_=76126735922a07bf","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642678735,"body":"God I wish that were me."},{"id":2275071,"gallery_id":388380,"poster":{"id":4043370,"username":"spoder9","slug":"spoder9","avatar_url":"avatars/4043370.png?_=42dc5a6763aa7b8b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642593095,"body":"the end was surprisingly abrupt for me. dunno how this progresses. still not wholesome"},{"id":2272632,"gallery_id":388380,"poster":{"id":3128735,"username":"fakeaccount11","slug":"fakeaccount11","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642516168,"body":"dafuq is this"},{"id":2272580,"gallery_id":388380,"poster":{"id":4988416,"username":"kurtzlor","slug":"kurtzlor","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642513666,"body":"She lost her mind at the end but the whole school looks shocked?"},{"id":2272003,"gallery_id":388380,"poster":{"id":2084578,"username":"jkdewa18","slug":"jkdewa18","avatar_url":"avatars/2084578.png?_=c7e75e1242bba2e8","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642489471,"body":"Waiting the next translation"},{"id":2271987,"gallery_id":388380,"poster":{"id":4881071,"username":"TheSandWitch","slug":"thesandwitch","avatar_url":"avatars/4881071.png?_=25bfc485c2848e96","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642489000,"body":"First part:312453\nBTW, anyone who has read further untranslated chapters and can tell if there's a story or smth?"}]
