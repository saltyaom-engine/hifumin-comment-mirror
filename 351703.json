Shitty tagging leads to stuff slipping through blacklists, artists getting their work split up, and making it harder to find stuff in general. The extra work should NOT fall on the user to manually search for shit constantly because of somebody fucking up the tags. TBH though I wouldn't be surprised if it's just a bot scraping these hentais and tags from a different site and uploading it without cleaning up/cross-referencing the info.
