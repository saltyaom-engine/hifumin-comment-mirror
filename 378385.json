It doesn't feel like they got enough events happening between them. Unlike with the first guy who even asked Kanan to step into more serious relationship and willingly helps her outside sex. Well, he's taken by Mari though. Dia's boyfriend is, kind of ambiguous but he did also asked Dia to go to the same campus so they can continue their relationship. In this one, seems like all six of them are getting into steady relationship, Mari with Kanan's sex friend, Kanan with his brother, and Dia with his junior. Series ends here, but the author says they still want to do more Mari and Sarah, so there are probably two more coming."}]
