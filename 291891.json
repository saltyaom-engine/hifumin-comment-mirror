But I have 2 thoughts that could change how it's seen. 1: His seniors forcibly pushed him into the store with them, If I know humans and seniors in any form of education, it's that they are assholes. With that being said, it's likely they ditched it after her both ordered and entered the room instead of doing the same. And it's likely this was a cruel joke if the vore doesn't kill him, or if the vore does kill him (which knowing how digestion works it very likely will) it was probably a plan from the start to kill him and make it seem like it was a fetish thing. 2: The fact the establishment is running with the Vore services, both suggests that at the very least Snake Girls are in this world and that it's perfectly legal to vore someone, which suggesting before, causing them to die with basically assisted suicide which is legal in that world if it's a fetish. - But what do I know?
