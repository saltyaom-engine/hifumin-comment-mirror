When they do talk about you, it's almost always gossiping or belittling. Also, the argument \"just try and make some friends\" is almost the same as telling \"just get a house\" to a homeless person. Finally, saying \"fuck them\" when it comes to bullies is kinda hard because you interact with them almost every day at school. A school's social circle isn't exactly big, it's just the same people again and again for years. Bit hard to just \"ignore them and chill\" when you always meet them, no?"},{"id":1690262,"gallery_id":355394,"poster":{"id":865063,"username":"InuyashaLitt","slug":"inuyashalitt","avatar_url":"avatars/865063.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618964445,"body":"I honestly don't understand why people get upset when someone ignores them or doesn't really talk to them, like just try and make some friends. \n\nBut if people are bullying you fuck them ignore them and just chill with yourself or get some friends that understand you it's not worth your time"},{"id":1683205,"gallery_id":355394,"poster":{"id":1561236,"username":"NeatoRARE","slug":"neatorare","avatar_url":"avatars/1561236.png?_=73ad2459c2b9953f","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618644864,"body":"Really should've done your research before making a deal with the devil"},{"id":1682661,"gallery_id":355394,"poster":{"id":2585660,"username":"Park Joon Gil","slug":"park-joon-gil","avatar_url":"avatars/2585660.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618614950,"body":"Potangina \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"},{"id":1682152,"gallery_id":355394,"poster":{"id":3849258,"username":"trapeziumgod","slug":"trapeziumgod","avatar_url":"avatars/3849258.png?_=a6d3e2a979470015","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618588294,"body":"aww, I was expecting this to be a series :("},{"id":1682004,"gallery_id":355394,"poster":{"id":3901278,"username":"Yash Nemar","slug":"yash-nemar","avatar_url":"avatars/3901278.png?_=717d495e96f7741a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618581531,"body":"LOL Karma "},{"id":1681781,"gallery_id":355394,"poster":{"id":397476,"username":"Commodore Perry","slug":"commodore-perry","avatar_url":"avatars/397476.png?_=c143690595eb51ca","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618570253,"body":"hot       "}]
