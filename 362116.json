Its more legal this way too, people spend a sizeable portion of their money buying makeup and other shit to fake looking young, with this forever youth portion, all men will work up to turn themselves into 10/10 model looking robots and  women will voluntarily turn themselves into 10/10 gynoids."},{"id":1797966,"gallery_id":362116,"poster":{"id":2650735,"username":"AbdulBhangi","slug":"abdulbhangi","avatar_url":"avatars/2650735.png?_=eb62cb9f9596f9ec","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1623322910,"body":"What is even the point of these robots? If they have the tech to create such life like robots already then there is no point in kidnapping young women and turning them into robots, you can just make these robots from scratch already. It looks like the body parts of these women are already swapped with 100% cybernetic implants, so there is no economic difference between making one from scratch and making one from using another women. \nIf its the 'emotions' that these robots lack, then its made mute when they are all turned into expressionless fleshlights. It would have made sense that if these women were brainwashed to emulate a personality to the liking of customers but thats not what happens here.
