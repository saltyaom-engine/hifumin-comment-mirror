Why does it have a skeletal buttstock if it's shoulder-fired? It's got features of a P08, which I guess would be okay, but where is the magazine? That design has to load from the bottom, it's not like you can just stick a box on the side. Could be a single-shot, but then there's no need for a fancy toggle-lock and you'd still need to load it from the bottom. Anyway, centaurides are cool."}]
