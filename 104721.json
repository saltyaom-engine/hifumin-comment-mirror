When you love someone enough that you're willing to help them get with another girl just to see them happy that's real love. But Yoshino was too sweet to voice her feelings in the actual anime. Because she didn't want the others to fight. I think I would watch this if it was just him and Yoshino they could call it My Lolli wife. She's two years younger than him. And I think the rest of the anime could be dedicated to getting her out of her shell and maybe she could let go of the puppet for a little bit. And be a little bit more outgoing and expressive with her feelings. like she was in this."},{"id":106538,"gallery_id":104721,"poster":{"id":987340,"username":"LaLoLo","slug":"lalolo","avatar_url":"avatars/987340.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1491111910,"body":"I finally got to see one of my biggest anime \"what ifs\" THANK YOU!!!\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f"}]
