These pairs are quantum entangled, meaning that if the spin of one of them changes, the spin of the other one also changes, no matter how far away they are. This is a problem, because that would mean that they exchange information with each other at a speed faster  than light, which isn't possible, but it's quantum mechanics so let's ignore that. Now, if such a pair appears at the event horizon, with each one on a different side, they can in theory exchange information about things inside the event horizon, this effect is called Hawking radiation (SIMPLIFIED BY A LOT).

For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be counterclockwise.

So every time matter is sucked into it, it just goes on adding to the singularity. Which is also why black holes can grow in size, the more they suck in. Black holes are really cool and you can do a lot of things with them (theoretically of course).

That doesnt mean that there cant be other lifeforms out there, if you wanna know more about that look into the fermi-paradox.

Well to answer this, you first have to understand that time and space are basically the same thing, hence its called space-time. Now, is it possible for the universe to be infinite? Maybe.

Point A to Point Z is the standard route. You read some doujin and came. But what if you didn't cum? That would be Point A to Point Y, you've changed the outcome of what would've been the \"normal\" outcome. These events would then predict what happens after aforementioned ejaculation. What if you edged yourself then accidentally came in your pants in public? That would be Point A to Point X. There is infinite outcomes so you could even have Points A-4 or V-81. With all that in mind, the Points are contained within larger ones. A to Z is life to death, but ejaculating to a doujin would deviate from A in progress to A-A1 to Z, eventually converging back unto Point Z (death). Which brings the next question, aren't all these Points contained within more Points? How many Points exist? Is there a limit to how many routes you can take into a Point?

We simply don't know the full expanses of the universe. humans only have the ability to see about 4% of the observable universe but the rest 96% is simply unknown. Due to this factor, there is a chance, albeit very low, that there is a planet like Earth with one blade of grass missing. This is talking about an Earthlike place that currently exists. If you are talking about an Earth-like place that may have existed, then if it is true that time is infinite, then there would have to be a chance that least one in this infinite time that a place like Earth with one blade of grass missing existed. To answer your third question, no. We only can dream of things that we have a current memory of. Even if a dream seems random, it is just a mish-mash of things we already know.

According to Einstein's equation E=mc^2, something like fusion taking place in the sun would require a reaction between two deuteriums creating helium. In this reaction, a small amount of mass is rubbed off of the atom, about the size of 1% of an election. However, when that mass is removed it creates enough heat and power that powers the sun. In a sense the sun is are \"destroying mass\" in order to create energy. I (Not so sure about this previous one maybe someone can correct me). But even if this previous statement is false, there would be a possibility that humans could break the laws of thermodynamics in the future since humans have been known for breaking limits before.

Such as transmuting an object out of nothing or even breaking the laws of thermodynamics. The answer to that question would be a solid maybe. While it has been put that the laws of thermodynamics are pretty final, and transmuting something would be pretty impossible to pull off, it might be possible to pull off. Transmuting let's say a rock out of thin air would be pretty hard. If you wanted to make a cube of sulfur, you would have to take oxygen and fuse them together. Not only would it be very unstable, but it would also require you to manipulate around 6.022x10^23 molecules of oxygen if you wanted to make a mole of sulfur. While it is difficult, we as humans have no way to look into the future. Maybe in the future, we will have access to technology allowing us to fuse and transmute something like sulfur out of thin air.

First, is multiverse theory real. Second, is there a reality where say magic takes over science or a world just like Earth but one blade of grass is missing. Third, are dreams a look into the past, present, and futures of these realities. The first questions seem to have been answered by just_one_comment and I can agree with his statement, the multiverse theory is most likely false. However, this does not mean that the other questions are inherently false as well. We could answer the second question by saying that magic and science are interchangeable. For instance, using something like a blender or a toaster seems like a normal everyday thing, whereas 500 years ago it would be considered magical. Hell, if a woman showed off a phone to others back in the day, she would be burned for being a witch. Even now, something like a flying car would seem like magic but it could be possible in a couple decades.

So the theory says, that each one of these possibility is its own universe, where (on a grand scale) things change. Sadly this doesnt allow magic or stuff like that because it would go against physics, and like I said, it doesnt change the universe, just decisions, kind of like a what if situation.
