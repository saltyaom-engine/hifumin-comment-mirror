I thought no one would be in a hurry to translate the final chapter of Oyster's long going \"HAF\" story. But they did. And it ends on a very dark note. It's is standard for Oyster but this one feels excessively darker. My only grip against it is that the real cause of all of Hanoka's pain gets off slightly easier than she did. I mean true she's still getting raped but not as bad as Hanoka. What's more all of her family has been killed while that broken GF still has her mom. And her broken condition isn't as Hanoka and she doesn't end up down in this pit. All-in-all with the whole series finally done it's okay. True it's excessively dark and gritty, but that's just par for the course for Oyster. Again my only grip is that the cause of all this (Tetsuo's old girlfriend) gets off somewhat easy. And normally Oyster makes everyone pay, but not this time. But again it's an OK story, especially for us sadistic types. So I give it an 8.5 out of 10."}]
