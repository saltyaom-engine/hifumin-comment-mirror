So for this cover, the story was featured in WEEKLY Kairakuten 2021 No.46: https://nhentai.net/g/383651/"},{"id":2223406,"gallery_id":385124,"poster":{"id":1299331,"username":"alonerone","slug":"alonerone","avatar_url":"avatars/1299331.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640574505,"body":"Damn cover is a fcking clickbait"}]
