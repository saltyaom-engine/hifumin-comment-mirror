Whether it be to live every moment to the fullest, be the happiest you can, be successful, find love, or just prolong your bloodline. Life never had meaning, and most of us will never be remembered by common folk in the years to come. Baking liked, hated, or never remembered, in the end it won't matter once we due, and when we do we just need to see what happens to us, whether we're ghosts, demons, angels, or put back on earth to live again. We simply live, die, and repeat the process. However that isn't sad, it is simply our existence."}]
