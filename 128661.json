My theory is that Inori in this hentai can only be seen by Shu and is a image of Inori's soul materializing inside the world as a reminiscence of Shu's power of King. Another proof of that is that they are not seen by anybody in the train, except for the last pages.\nThis could be a real theory without them tho.
