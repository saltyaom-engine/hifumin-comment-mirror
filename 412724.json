The loser will have to do public love confession to the winner. Souta, already got a 10/15 losing streak in their class' game. But rather than play it safe by betting on the senior who work as model, he wants to get all for himself. Yet he got no candidate who has the potential. The class rep, asks him to accompany her visiting Himari, their hikikomori classmate. Souta and Himari was childhood friend, even though they've stopped meeting each other since middle school. He's not interested though, as he want to focus on finding girl for the contest. But Himari, whom he thought had grown fat from the unhealthy lifestyle, actually grew up into a pretty and sexy girl. He decided to help Himari get out, first by getting her used to contact with other person (then ends in sex). Seeing Himari got out of her room, her mother left her at Souta's care."}]
