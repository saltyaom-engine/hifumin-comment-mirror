There are two canonical endings to Azur Lane's story a). Ashes ending, where a lot of shipgirls die, Sirens are created to replace them, and the Sirens go back in time and start the story all over again. b). Playable version of Azur Lane, where Mirror Seas keep popping up, which allow commanders to relive events from the past (events and reruns). Yes shipgirls don't age, as Belfast stated in the Lady of Tomorrow event. And yes, the war can be ended. 2. Technically yes, there is only one commander, but due to the Alternate Timelines theory, there are different timelines, each with a different commander (different accounts). Yes, they can communicate, but only after the war ends (guilds) 3.

Like that's a good thing to make how this Azur Lane plot ended.\n\nFor those who don't know, all stories in an online game is mostly just left there when they cannot be milked or usuable again on the future. So, how the Azur Lane, or Kancolle team put an end to that. Or what about another game? As Azur Lane itself, I have question about that:\n\n1. How you would end that story? Is the shipgirls just don't age, while their Admiral can? Or would they become human, birth and death, can be put together? Is the war can be ended? What if another 10 year?\n\n2. No other Admiral? Is just the player the only Admiral there? Is they can communicate? Build strategy? Put an end to the war?"},{"id":1629210,"gallery_id":351314,"poster":{"id":3718395,"username":"hitlertayo","slug":"hitlertayo","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1616227242,"body":"3.

Can they be so tired of the war, they just become US in WW2 where they just sit there?\n\n6. Siren side? Aren't they also tired of that war? Are they become Germany in WW1 when they just tired of trench warfare?\n\n7. End of the shipgirls? Where are they after the war? Following their Admiral? Join the Navy of their country? Follow the conflict after war? Or suicide because they heartbroken after the loss of their Admiral\n\n8. The shipgirls humanity side? Politics side? Idea? \n\n9. Manjuus? Are they just smaller human?
