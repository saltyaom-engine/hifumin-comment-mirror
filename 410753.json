He's specialized in erotic skills, and would pound any holes he can find, even manholes (no idea if it's literal or pun). He tried doing NTR in front of Midoriya, but ends up getting beaten instead (because seeing Todoroki being dominated like that turns him on). According to profile, that villain took Shigaraki's virginity. | Anyone got complete timeline of this series? Seems like there's another story with that really pretty long haired Todoroki before this.
