Masochism is an evolved trait that typically balances sadism- which was an adaptation to promote aggression for inter-tribe battles and hunting.  Think of it as sexualising defeatism and victimhood. Most people develop sadism first, then realize how most of the time their dreams are unfulfilled. Loss and regret pile up, and then BINGO; your brain starts to fetishize sexual defeat. For men, it is far more perverted to be M than S, because society expects S from men. Once you get a taste for it, its really addicting. I'm a bi-switch, which means I enjoy both (light) S & M, men&women, bois and gurls. Why limit yourself?"},{"id":1254220,"gallery_id":322332,"poster":{"id":3654637,"username":"MoanChomsky","slug":"moanchomsky","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1601912173,"body":"This is pretty comical to be honest.
