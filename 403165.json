A bit sad, actually. Woman actually doesn't feel a thing with her hubby but doesn't tell him how lame he is because of their financial pinch (he's jobless). So, basically, the story is steadily moving to a situation where \u2018bigger takes all\u2019. Let's just hope she still keeps her wits around."},{"id":2525263,"gallery_id":403165,"poster":{"id":4627450,"username":"\u7d2b\u306e\u732b","slug":"zi-nomao","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1652572691,"body":"Honestly just read because of how ugly the guys are.
