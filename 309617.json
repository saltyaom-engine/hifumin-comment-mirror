But there's a lot more to say about this I feel. This seems to be some sort of bizarre and hyper specific fetish or something except I've literally never seen anything even remotely resembling this before so I think it was just made for the author's enjoyment. The utter lack of continuity between some of the pages coupled with the absence of dialogue make it almost impossible to tell what the fuck is going on, further implying that this was made for the artist alone. Speaking of which! There's no artist listed, despite there being like half a dozen of these monstrosities littered across the site. Also like, these feature touhou characters but they also all have some fucking OC in there??

Finally now, when the comments are working again, I can humbly ask a polite question: who the FUCK in the world came with the idea to upload THIS here? I mean, this marginal comic is a last thing in a world that can be called a hentai. It's poorly drawn, it looks dumb, it have no plot, it's even not a bit sexy, for fuck's sake!"}]
