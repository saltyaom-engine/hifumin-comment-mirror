In the case of this story though, the boys cheated and didn't deserve to win from a narrative perspect. They didn't *earn* a victory. It would be very poor story telling if they couldn't overcome the Shell Jutsu on their own through practice or something. Especially the other 3 guys coming in at the end. That was a nice touch to allow the better \"warrior\"  to win and reveal she was just helping the others get a win, maybe trying to boost their confidence , effectively showing that she's a good person.

For the sake of relevance I'll stick to hentai for making a point. But seriously look around, do you see how much female rape, blackmail and mind break there is in hentai? Women rarely win in hentai, perhaps its time you came out of your own bubble and actually viewed the whole world not just the little bits you get a peek at from inside. "}]
