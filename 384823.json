On e-hentai.org, \"gender bender\" was changed to \"gender change\" due to \"gender bender\" used to be mutually exclusive with \"body swap\", which used to be very confusing. In addition, many people dislike \"gender bender\" doujin with elemets such as possession and bodyswap\nThe tag \"gender morph\" is now a seperate one for only transformation from male to female and vice versa.
