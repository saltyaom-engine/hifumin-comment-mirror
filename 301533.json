Asahi found out, and rather than force her to give him explanation, he wants to accept all of her. Waka actually asks to break up because she can't stand feeling guilty of taking advantage from his kindness. A month later, Asahi waited for her under the rain, to propose her on her birthday. She run away again, this time to that guy. She told him to ask no question and just fuck her until she can't think of anything else. Asahi had been the only person in her life, so she had nobody else to turn to. In the end, that guy told her, Asahi loves her and she loves Asahi too. If Asahi will accept her dirty self, then she should accept the proposal. They marry in April (after her pregnancy is confirmed) with nobody congratulating. Gave birth in December, then graduate (her parents won't let her drop out). Asahi's colleague actually worried if she will cheat on him, because people their age would still want to have fun."},{"id":2152001,"gallery_id":301533,"poster":{"id":3520886,"username":"DATABASE","slug":"database","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1637332793,"body":"she's btich..."},{"id":1421694,"gallery_id":301533,"poster":{"id":3419092,"username":"zikakuto","slug":"zikakuto","avatar_url":"avatars/3419092.png?_=447dcb06b77e5440","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1608565890,"body":"Honestly, better to imagine an ending where he moves on.
