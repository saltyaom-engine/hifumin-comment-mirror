I think it is far more satisfying that Jun recognized that defending the honor of a lying cockslut like Katsuko would be foolish. Kazuya isn't even doing anything wrong. Yeah he's kind of a jerk but remember that Katsuko wouldn't even let Jun finger her at school but she's fine with getting loudly full-on  fucked  when it's Kazuya,  or even exposing herself to Jun during class.  It's Katsuko that's the problem, it was always Katsuko.
