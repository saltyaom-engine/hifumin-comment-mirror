That girl made an ahegao (still debating whether it can be considered or not) that had a beautiful balance of two opposing characteristics, namely, the retarded expression, and the communication of lust. Don't let the face fool you, this girl has surpassed a world beyond Nirvana's perception. Every paticle in her body vibrates to the hymn of the phallic deities. Too often these days we find artists playing it safe with heart pupils and stuck-out tongues, which doesn't look retarded at all, and is more of a convention for communicating an intense feeling of pleasure.  Bless this artist for showing us the light."},{"id":335209,"gallery_id":217093,"poster":{"id":1101818,"username":"jjx66","slug":"jjx66","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1513297178,"body":"worth the long wait"}]
