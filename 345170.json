He only went out with her is so he can brag about his relationship with the female etc. how soft her breast felt when he touched them, sex, like he said in the doujin. And She felt like he didn't like her as much as she likes him so she confronts her frustration in their current relationship with her friends. At this point, all of the classmates already have grudges against him and now they knew what he has done to her. They simply felt like they have had enough of him and isolate him from the rest of them. This hit his ego by a lot. So he went to the roof. And then the girlfriend went to the roof to asks for a breakup. \n\njust a second ago he was isolated from his classmate and now his GL is asking to break up with him, he couldn't take it so he's being apologetic to the GL and ask for her forgiveness. GL is soft-hearted and forgave him. Thus they have sex on the roof.
