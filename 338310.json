Since Pecans works are a little bit repetitive, this one kept me with surprise. The torture of the boy is quiet original and funny. I sincerely hope that he might contine that path, as the above work is pure dark comedy gold."},{"id":1381479,"gallery_id":338310,"poster":{"id":546982,"username":"Ravenleaf","slug":"ravenleaf","avatar_url":"avatars/546982.png?_=5e6e2f0ec437fe4f","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1607020611,"body":"Honestly, I can't understand the lore of Pecan's world. Like, are all men subs and game for torment and castration? If so, why does he occasionally have these works where there is some Alpha guys getting the girls regularly instead of being abused? It seems like the whole world looks down on men in 90% of the cases, but there is this very small group of alpha males that show up to make the losers feel that much worse "}]
