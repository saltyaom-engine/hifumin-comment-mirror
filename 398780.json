All their stories have pretty guys who have all the design elements and personality of Shoujo, and the art in general looks like one. Even the NTR isn't about the male figure, but the female. It's pretty interesting, considering this is not the choice of most doujin artist.\nNonetheless, awesome art, the plot seems to be interesting, with a lot of pages, lots of scenes and overall very good poses.
