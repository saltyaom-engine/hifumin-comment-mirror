That being said, this was Boeun\u2019s (lit in Japanese) debut work *in LO*, it says it on the P243. Obviously not every amateur artist debuts their first doujin in LO, airandou being a good example, but it also very likely that they\u2019re a fairly new artist in terms of doujins if they\u2019re \u201cdebuting\u201d in a comic series of any kind. Finally, it\u2019s not kanji, it\u2019s hiragana, which is likely why google translate gave you a weird translation, \u201cBouen\u201d is the correct name as hiragana is generally used for Japanese words/names, if it was in katakana: \u201cBowen\u201d may be a way to translate it. So the artist you found on sankaku is likely the same person, especially if as you said, the art is similar.

Maeshima Ryou\u2019s continues to have superb art and ahegao, though I\u2019m still not a particular fan of MMF stuff. A surprisingly vanilla work from Kamita, took me by surprise, but it\u2019s a bit \u201ctoo\u201d vanilla for me personally, just kinda lackluster. Onizuku Naoshi\u2019s and Hasblow cream\u2019s work are okay art, but I really dislike boyish lolis. Ujiie Moku and Mamezou\u2019s work had potential and good art, but I don\u2019t like anal or anal focus, also the latter has the weird suppository thing in the beginning. Fuyutzugu\u2019s work is pretty good, but again, not a fan of MMF. Shishisenmaru is not someone I\u2019m familiar with, but their art seems nice, the work is a bit too short and I don\u2019t like ugly bastard.
