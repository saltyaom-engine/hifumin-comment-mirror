Seemingly from panel to panel, it appears to go from walking in the street in front of a store and then the next panel shows them in a crowded train or something, problem is, the panels before that are dark with little text for change in the transition. Might want to make use of those spaces more for a more subtle transition between the scenes. (tl;dr nb4 \"every one is a critic\")"}]
