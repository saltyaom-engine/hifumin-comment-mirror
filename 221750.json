The only added important thing was that Saitama tricked her into thinking it was all a dream by proposing to her, which excited her so much she fainted.  Then he put her clothes back on etc.  Genos had been watching the whole time.  Saitama said he wasn't sure how much was the drug and how much was him but thought that this was the best way to handle it.  Genos then said he had taken the drug too and now couldn't help himself but try to sleep with Saitama...Saitama then said...wait a second...the drug shouldn't work on you cuz you're a robot right? and then Genos was like...damn... you figured it out.."},{"id":817867,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":1457179,"username":"mrotakune","slug":"mrotakune","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1550198229,"body":"PLEASE TRANSLATE SOON!!!!"},{"id":763068,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":962796,"username":"So Stupid","slug":"so-stupid","avatar_url":"avatars/962796.png?_=6a0e86f26a2ed03d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1545524220,"body":"@death19 You must now pay the price for your request"},{"id":725856,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":1812108,"username":"death19","slug":"death19","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1541324195,"body":"Cant...read...this...,need...translation...in...English "},{"id":714950,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":1474672,"username":"Abusive Plague Doctor","slug":"abusive-plague-doctor","avatar_url":"avatars/1474672.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1540019131,"body":"This one is quite stale compared to the other ones...."},{"id":654911,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":1869050,"username":"WhosRem","slug":"whosrem","avatar_url":"avatars/1869050.png?_=fbf66a57337f5d1c","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1534105292,"body":"@slivko yeah these are gold.\nNothing much just created this account only to comment this.\nif some how the author see this.Keep up the good work man."},{"id":650119,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":1220573,"username":"nekoinanut","slug":"nekoinanut","avatar_url":"avatars/1220573.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1533620234,"body":"ooh Giorno pose i see ;)"},{"id":610973,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":1605957,"username":"BigNutBuss64","slug":"bignutbuss64","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1533329265,"body":"Yeah I hope this isn\u2019t the end.

Really Amazing stuff I hope the author can see how much we love his work. Its so High quality like this resembles the Manga like 80% perhaps 90% in terms of visuals. Cant wait for the translation also please let this not be the end, and I personaly ask no more NTR just let the relationship of Saitama and Fubuki and Tatsumaki go smoothly. For what I could tell in this one Fubuki decided to go agressive but Saitama was going a little crazy so after Fubuki rejected his agressiveness he punched himself and tried to take things a lot better so she wouldnt feel bad. Cant wait for English to confirme my theory but I think Ill be disappointed cause she woke up in the end so I hope that that wasnt all just a dream :C."},{"id":568559,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":1600637,"username":"Ferasu","slug":"ferasu","avatar_url":"avatars/1600637.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1531128909,"body":"@gintama696969 father nhentai is not very pleased"},{"id":523607,"gallery_id":221750,"poster":{"id":1672604,"username":"gintama696969","slug":"gintama696969","avatar_url":"avatars/1672604.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1527692515,"body":"English translation pls "}]
