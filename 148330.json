He stared at me with an evil grin, and the smile on his hoodie was terrifying. I broke into a sweat and began to run as fast as I could to the other way. I looked back and he was still right there chasing me, gaining speed. I started praying for God to save my soul. He was getting closer. But I had finally reached my house, still ready to keep running (I am a Sigma Male). I stood at my desk (Sitting is for Betas). I turned on my computer and was horrified to see Dream's YouTube page opened up, with my subscription added. As I looked behind me I saw him. The kid (12M) was right there.
