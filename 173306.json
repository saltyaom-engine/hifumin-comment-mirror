You can envision it as her getting an abortion and beginning anew with Gin. Or you can envision it as Gin losing his shit over the situation. Both are pretty plausible to me. In any case I do agree the ending isn't really \"happy\".

The first chapter is what happened after this chapter so in the end, they actually got together. \r\n\r\nChapter 1 was the \"prologue\" but also the continuation of chapter 7. It's confusing but makes sense when you take everything into consideration, especially when the graduation scene looks so similar to chapter 1 and when I see what Pierrot said. In chapter 1, she didn't act like a Virginia. When she ran to the \"person\" in this chapter, it mirrors the approach to Gin in chapter 1, but we're made to assume that she ran to the teacher. Very fucking clever yuzuki n dash.  Very fucking clever. The teacher made her more feminine in appearance. Whether it was intentional or not Gin ended up realizing her femininity because of what the teacher did. Still an ass hole for the ntr shit but yeah I think I get the ending now.

(Give up) when she found out about being pregnant and maybe the final page (when she is holding Gin hand as a child) is like a frozen moment in time for the two of them because in the present they would never be together (becuase Setsuna idiocy &amp; choices {not seeking help, not confronting her problems, not using protection, etc.)  continue -"},{"id":60551,"gallery_id":173306,"poster":{"id":714946,"username":"Troncol","slug":"troncol","avatar_url":"avatars/714946.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1473258711,"body":"@KuriYokan - I agree with you..."},{"id":60550,"gallery_id":173306,"poster":{"id":714946,"username":"Troncol","slug":"troncol","avatar_url":"avatars/714946.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1473258514,"body":"@Enoch  - NTR isn't just between established couples when it comes to hentai and such...it also pertains to strongly potential couples...ie...a couple that WOULD have ended up together if the douche didn't come out of nowhere and literally rape the girl away from the guy."},{"id":60549,"gallery_id":173306,"poster":{"id":35594,"username":"4rcane","slug":"4rcane","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1473257992,"body":"tomoe (friend of setsuna) confesses to gin, setsuna ran off without listening to gin's response\r\nSetsuna end up getting raped by teacher, have lots of sex \r\nSetsuna end up pregnant before graduation\r\nGin confesses to Setsuna at graduation and have sex after Setsuna already found out she was pregant with teacher"},{"id":60540,"gallery_id":173306,"poster":{"id":90990,"username":"KuriYokan","slug":"kuriyokan","avatar_url":"avatars/90990.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1473250440,"body":"I think that smile is not that \"she doesn't regret\", it's the \"I fucking give up\" smile.
