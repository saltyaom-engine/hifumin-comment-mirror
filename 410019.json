She made a deal to return both the Hero and his friends' life, but after they defeated the Demon King, a curse will activate to turn him into a succubus. Officially, the Hero went to hiding after completing his mission. A pair of succubus sister shows up later, and they're rumoured to be even more powerful than the Demon King (and pops up randomly rather than wait in the castle). Officials are still denying their existence (probably still in celebration mood, or to avoid public unrest) while waiting for the next Hero to show up."},{"id":2631457,"gallery_id":410019,"poster":{"id":667423,"username":"ryoram","slug":"ryoram","avatar_url":"avatars/667423.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657289729,"body":"Well, I was always wondering if there would be a 2nd part .... now I want a 3rd part"},{"id":2631272,"gallery_id":410019,"poster":{"id":1595243,"username":"LordCellofEarth9","slug":"lordcellofearth9","avatar_url":"avatars/1595243.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657278510,"body":"Oh sweet!
