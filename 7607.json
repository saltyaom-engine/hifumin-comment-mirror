I am confused. Why the hell did Naruto (as Sasuke) jump on the tree and take a swing. Can't see the reason why unless he is a crazy fuck. Maybe it was so she didn't notice the real Sasuke which was probably reason. Very strange way to not get basted. Well, as long as it works lol! It should have been obvious to Sakura it's Naruto since he is saying Sakura-chan. Maybe she just was too naughty and didn't care. As long as the dude looks as Sasuke, that's the important thing. :D"}]
