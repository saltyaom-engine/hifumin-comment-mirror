Granted, there are exceptions where the boy is either perverted, corrupted, or ugly, or all of the above, but I'm a vanilla guy through and through so I'm really not a fan of perverted protagonists. Also, I've always been into older women, so to be young and get attractive girls like these kids is something of a fantasy of mine."},{"id":838397,"gallery_id":265244,"poster":{"id":2031778,"username":"PizzaPete","slug":"pizzapete","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1552005424,"body":"You know I don't really get why people are attracted to shotacon stuff. Is it because it displays small dick energy and like you can relate? Or is it like the sensation of being dominated or some shit? I don't really get it. Like shotacon, dilf, and fat dudes it never really make sense for me. Just have the normal hentai protag in which their hair covers their eyes."}]
