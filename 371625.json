Kinda wondering what it is as Shoma supporting both of them just so Yuki can be \"happy\" isn't really a twist given how that happens quite a bit in NTR stories, so I'm guessing this is the final push Shoma needed to expose everything. Feel like both Shoma(quits) and Yuki(expelled) leave the team and the coach gets fired/arrested.
