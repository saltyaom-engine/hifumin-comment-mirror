I have so many questions right now. 1- Why does this exist? I mean, it's not trash but why? 2- What's this about? 3- Why did this start like a normal doujin but then it fricked up? 4- What has GG to see here? Some characters just appear, but do nothing interesting.\nI thought this was gonna be one of my favorites doujins since it was about my 2 favorite games, but sadly it wasn't like that. 3/10 just because the drawing style is good."}]
