Just look at all that sexyness that just oozes out of her. In a way, hating her would be like hating Saeko Busujima from Highschool of the Dead. There's almost no difference between the two, other than the terms of the sibling complex from Camilla. They are both sexy purple haired bombshells. They are top excellent fighters. They both more or less have a sadistic personality. And they both provide ridiculous amounts of fanservice. So they are practically no different from each other."},{"id":54459,"gallery_id":169585,"poster":{"id":34199,"username":"NullHorizon","slug":"nullhorizon","avatar_url":"avatars/34199.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1469391074,"body":"I...
