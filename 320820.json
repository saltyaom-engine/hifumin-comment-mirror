More importantly is the feeling of loss and betrayal on the part of the MC. That's what makes NTR."},{"id":1085761,"gallery_id":320820,"poster":{"id":1521280,"username":"WNFan_","slug":"wnfan_","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1595061329,"body":"Fuck. This. Shit. I wanted to like this, because the art style is really good. But I can't do it. I know it doesn't count as NTR as the MC isn't going out with her, but it still gives me that vibe that I despise so much that stems from NTR."}]
