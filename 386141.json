Thankfully I decided to learn Japanese as a 2nd year middle schooler who loved anime and learnt it just for fun, and now as an adult, I have access to understanding these types of manga. Though kinda implausible, the plot wasn't that generic though, and to me personally it's still more interesting and better than #293940, and the art style looks quite cute and appealling, I'd give it 8.1/10"}]
