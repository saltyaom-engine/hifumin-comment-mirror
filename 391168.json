A gumiho or kumiho is a Korean version of Japanese kitsune. Unlike the Japan version that acted more like tricksters, guardians and lovers in some myths. The Gumiho in Korean tales is a malevolent evil entity that preys on humans especially young boys by shapeshifting into a seductive beautiful lady. Once the victim is lured in even after sex, the gumiho would kill and eat her prey, specifically the liver and hearts. So don't ever mistook Gumiho from Korea as the same as Kitsune from Japan.
