His nephew, on the other hand, was always precocious and rather mature, and his niece soon followed her brother's steps once their parents died, probably to keep their family together.

This was a happy ending, but its not confirmed if they're really siblings or not. I bet they weren't tho. Anyway, enjoy the story. Also, the plot is good, you thought it was him, but its actually not.

Bad hentai. Thanks for translating it so non-JP readers can read Fuuga's work, KenGotTheLexGs. Anyway, if anyone is puzzled by the ending, I think it was hinted that Rei and Mei's mother and her brother may have had sexual relationship in the past too (as he smiles looking at them holding hands and how much she cared about him). And to think there's no actual confirmation Re and Mei are actual blood siblings...Well... They also started to realize their current \"relationship\" will not last, but they chose to live the present to the fullest anyway. One day they may ended up like their mother &amp; uncle. At some point, Masato and Aki may break up and Rei can finally get what she wants from the start. Who knows. I guess Fuuga need to polished his skills at telling stories and start his own non-H manga series one day. You can tell how much this series was held back by its hentai shell instead being actual manga. 8/10 for me. Not as good as \"Teacher and Student\", but good read."},{"id":2246643,"gallery_id":386802,"poster":{"id":3637164,"username":"Esas","slug":"esas","avatar_url":"avatars/3637164.png?_=a46b19a7bb6192fd","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641477201,"body":"nice? nice."},{"id":2246578,"gallery_id":386802,"poster":{"id":4720388,"username":"NiGHTMARE","slug":"nightmare","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641474799,"body":"Alas completed....right?"},{"id":2246414,"gallery_id":386802,"poster":{"id":4675629,"username":"trashthrowaway2","slug":"trashthrowaway2","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641466623,"body":"All things considered, good story?"}]
