I think she had the same control over him her as she did in the other one to explain why he could only meekly do as the girls wanted and get \"Dickgirl on Male\".....or forced to rape them (that part was more he was broken so badly and knowing Lyria could and WOULD force him anyway, did so regrettably). Lyria mentioned she and Gran/Djeeta feel the same things through their bond. Meaning there's a part of them that wants to do this, their just to \"goody\" to ever want to do so (hence Gran's look of horror after she released the control and he remembered everything he did!). Honestly I've noticed alot of Lyria getting corrupted and going crazy yandere evil to make Gran/Djeeta her's stories lately :)"},{"id":2254017,"gallery_id":387254,"poster":{"id":737835,"username":"Anonimax","slug":"anonimax","avatar_url":"avatars/737835.png?_=e47ec89009213fe5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641776172,"body":"What a twist.
