She accepts a date with the captain but stands him up because she wants to be with Kazuya. I mean she invites him in, makes him take a shower, and purposefully walks in on him in the shower. Then she willingly has sex with the team, I guess she\u2019s feeling bad for standing up the captain and also wants Kazuya on the team. Then she gets caught. It\u2019s weird how she gets everything to go her way with Kazuya just by ordering him, there\u2019s never a moment where she has to reckon with her choices. It\u2019s a long series of chapters so felt they could have had that in there. But other than that, this is a great read, love how weirdly wholesome it was, and the senpai and team members supporting them in the end lol."},{"id":1655706,"gallery_id":81668,"poster":{"id":3419092,"username":"zikakuto","slug":"zikakuto","avatar_url":"avatars/3419092.png?_=447dcb06b77e5440","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1617361540,"body":"At first, the fourth story where Haruka has sex with Jyunko rubbed me the wrong way. The whole time she\u2019s talking about having had sex with Mitsuo in graphic detail, her sister\u2019s boyfriend. But then instant karma where Jyunko gets easily taken away by the sister. That had me rolling in stitches.
