I see an image of a random score posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. \"Oh that looks kinda like the Blue Zenith 727 score\" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a clock with time that showed 7:27, I'd see that I'm on the 7/27 page on my school homework, my last notice to pay my electricity bill is 727$ , I'd notice that it's been 727 days since the last time I touched a woman. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the number 727 ran through my head. I'm scared to look at the time when someone asks me what time is it. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an 3-digit number which is anywhere close to 727. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the phrase \"when you see it\" again without thinking of 727."}]
