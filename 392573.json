And the tragedy, the story let's us know that Boy on his way to take her back, fell and broke his phone, that's why Girl couldn't get a hold of him then she was consumed by producer Guy. The last page is the real kicker here and can be up for interpretation. My take is Girl is in turmoil. I believe she hears the conversation between Boy and Guy at the door, and why Boy was too late. Girl pluck the bass string to get Boy's attention, to exposed herself, hurt him, and imply \"you are too late\", \"you made me do this\". Real psycho move to drive the reality to the Boy."},{"id":2347657,"gallery_id":392573,"poster":{"id":3480273,"username":"HentaiKingTestamentBasara","slug":"hentaikingtestamentbasara","avatar_url":"avatars/3480273.png?_=42ff753c31961fe6","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1645286588,"body":"Honestly she should still feel like a huge bitch out of guilt.
