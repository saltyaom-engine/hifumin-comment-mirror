This chapter's title is \"Watashi wa Kokohaku suru\" which means \"I confesses\" or \"I will confess\". One would normally assume that this refers to Tsutsumi but thing is, he doesn't use Watashi (a feminine-neutral pronoun) to refer to himself but rather uses Ore (very masculine). So this could definitely mean many things like: the title could be referring to Anna(?) or someone else, but one could also think that this hints about Tsutsumi being a girl.

It kind of builds/expands the world that the author is writing, giving us a different perspective to ongoing/past/future events as well. Also in Rarefure, they never showed the teacher. So this is a pleasant revelation--to think that Suma sensei was actually the teacher of all those characters. Also interesting that given Manami was supposed to be the most popular? (correct me if I'm wrong) in the school, for these bunch of male classmates like Kise they only have eyes for Karin.

It's the 1st page of Ch 6. When I first read it, I thought that back view of the char Yuuki and Karen were talking to looked like Manami. Also cos both were talking to that char, I kinda made the link there. So far they mainly interacted with each other in their cameos or individually interacted with the class. So for both them to be talking to one char, I thought it was likely to be from Rarefure too. But indeed, I guess we can't confirm from what we are shown.

I've mentioned it a bit before in my summary for Chapter 5 where the girls from Rarefure first appeared as cameo. I also talked about it in my Rarefure summary intro. Both stories actually are set in the same universe, in the same school, and even in the same class. Basically, the Rarefure gang are also Suma Sensei's students. Speaking of cameos, there was a cameo from the future (sorta like an easter egg, I guess) in Rarefure where MC had a sexy magazine of Houra as an AV model. That chapter came out like years before Itaiamai even started its serialization. Cool stuff. Btw, can you tell me what chapter did Manami had a cameo?
