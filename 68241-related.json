They could be cousins or something...which isn't as frowned upon as it is in other places. It's not very common, but cousins can marry.

He took her virginity and her first love so he should be happy for her that she found a man who would love her as she is. Just think of this: He's her 2nd man so you still win as you're her 1st man, 1st love, 1st lover albeit unofficial, first dick, first creampie and it would never change although the 2nd guy still wins as she would bear his child/ren and be his until death. Well, they can't be together as they are siblings so it's the best outcome.\nThe last story is a whack. lol. They just had sex then will eat softshelled turtle which boosts stamina and libido.\n"}]
