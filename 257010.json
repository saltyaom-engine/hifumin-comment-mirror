I don't know why, but somehow they manage to fuck up every single hentai anime adaption. So many great hentai manga have gotten really, really shitty anime adaptions recently. For some reason the only decent hentai anime, that I've seen recently, are the one's that aren't based on a manga. No idea why. Maybe getting the rights for a manga takes away so much money from the budget that they don't have enough left to afford good animations"},{"id":767903,"gallery_id":257010,"poster":{"id":1140601,"username":"Rendarg","slug":"rendarg","avatar_url":"avatars/1140601.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1545972583,"body":"Finally, a \"Joshi Luck\" Collected Edition.
