Very messed up, but somehow straddling the line where it\u2019s not incomprehensible. @smelly_armpits_boy it\u2019s the boyfriend.

Because I can't understand if in the end she starts loving her boyfried again, or keeps loving the raper (even if dead) 2) why has no one commented this manga yet ? It has been 4 years already from its release :/"}]
