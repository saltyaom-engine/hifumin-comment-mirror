Love the stories where the \"good guy\" wins and then show they can be scummy as the bad guy....but well between a \"Hero/Heroine\" that's selling a villain that has likely killed a shit ton of innocents for the EVULZ to a life of sex slavery and Said Villain who has done that! Kind of hard to lecture the hero! Villainess is just getting karma (The humiliation of being a slave to those she once looked down upon and killed with glee! She's best left mind broken forever! Her ego wouldn't be able to survive the humiliation ESPECIALLY if it lasts VERY LONG) On the other hand!
