The church are the typical \"Divine War Instigators\" basically the girls are made to birth the future \"Hero\" that will \"conveniently be an orphan they took in and raised as a Hero!\" (The black haired boy is pretty much her son the \"hero\"). While the one who birthed the chosen one would also be made to birth the \"Demon Lord!\" Seems the Church and the Demons are all working together! The other girls broke, so are reduced to \"Demon Making Sows\" while the Chick was let go likely because they knew she'd be thrown away once her sex fix screwed her over! I think she has to be in the pits of despair and hope for the Hero and Demon Lord thing to work (Demon Lord means she is at the pits of despair) as they say in these's stories \"Have the mother of the Demon Lord or the Hero EVER been relevant?\" that's what she is! Her life was over the moment she was chosen. A Sacrifice to keep those in power IN POWER! Not a Lucky Pick, but instead an \"Unlucky One\""},{"id":2423775,"gallery_id":397233,"poster":{"id":2533768,"username":"erocommander","slug":"erocommander","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1648481150,"body":"What happened to the girl from Yamada Gogogo?
