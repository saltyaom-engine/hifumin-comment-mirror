The Alraune story leaving it a question mark if the Adventurer is just an extension of the Alarune talking through her at the end, or if she brainwashed her like what happened in the Slime girl one that she now takes joy in doing to other girls what her mistress did to the girls she previously tried to avenge! And the Succubus one where she was turned into a lesser Succubus and feels nothing betraying her old female friends and bringing the same fate on them if it makes her mistress love her more! Hate the Lamia one where she loses her personality though! Can't wait for this in ENGLISH)"}]
