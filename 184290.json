There is a river there too. It flows unfazed by these things, \"indescribable and vast spaces of void dead existence that never was or will be\" is how i once heard a shadow that might of once been a man describe them, but he was gone before we could speak further. thats just how life is sometimes. Too this day I haven't had a chance to see that river, but one day, perhaps when I'm a very old man I will go back and gaze at it, and remember the good times and the bad, what was and what could have been."}]
