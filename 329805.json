Apparently, after experienced things for the first time, she went further and further, developing a more \"sadistic\" or \"meaner\" side of herself during sex.\n\nDuring the last scene with Amana, she recalls many things that had happened beforehand (apparently, she didn't only do this with the twins but also Hazuki and maybe Producer too, dunno if this producer is male or female tho since this is yuri oriented lol) and thinking that she failed as an adult and ended up corrupting the children she was supposed to be taking care of. She kind of broken down when Amana said she loved Chiyuki and showing a pretty \"satisfied\" face after causing Chiyuki to orgasm, which reflected what she had become and think that is rubbing off onto Amana. She responds to Amana's confession, but still cry out of grief.\n\nFrom my limited Japanese, that's probably the plot considering the prequel. I expect no less from this author lol"},{"id":1298782,"gallery_id":329805,"poster":{"id":771577,"username":"Solidification","slug":"solidification","avatar_url":"avatars/771577.png?_=bf50f172614cc6a7","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1603825829,"body":"probably bc the other girl is gonna die or she's leaving that's why they're crying"},{"id":1260857,"gallery_id":329805,"poster":{"id":3343395,"username":"Chro","slug":"chro","avatar_url":"avatars/3343395.png?_=4af9d9e80728a019","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1602226757,"body":"There must be some deep shit written here, I just know it..."},{"id":1248205,"gallery_id":329805,"poster":{"id":3364802,"username":"YURI_IS_GOOD","slug":"yuri_is_good","avatar_url":"avatars/3364802.png?_=9717c6da3818c3a3","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1601656796,"body":"@Mr.Bombastic sometimes sex can be pretty intense, and some people can only let their supress emotions out during the session.
