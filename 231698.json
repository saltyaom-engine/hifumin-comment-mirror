At the very least, the mangaka hasn't updated his blog in quite awhile, and his last message had some sort of \"this is the end of this so i can get back to focusing on the actual doujin\" kind of feel to it (my Japanese is pretty basic, so I'm not 100% sure on the translation. Although it has some NTR-ish moments, the ending of it thus far is pretty vanilla; the sex with huge dick/sexmaniac friend has basically just improved the main couple's sex life overall. No idea if there'll be more, or if this is all the mangaka will write for this series."}]
