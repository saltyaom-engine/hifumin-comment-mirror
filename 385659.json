They made a deal, the village will support him in gathering the treasures from all tribes (+ Silva as his companion in the quest). In exchange, he will help impregnate the elves. Elves had been declining, and with weakening magic element pool, they don't get pregnant easily. His sperm which got high quantity of magic element might work.
