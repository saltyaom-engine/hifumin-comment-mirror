It paints The fox as a an innocent creature even though we all know she is the expressive type of personality. And unlike other art i see of her here,she actually has cat eyes. Other artists forget this fact and draw her eye's too human-like (what i mean is they draw the black insides of the eyes round).\n\nHmm,nothing much to be said about the strips really. Although i am concerned over the fact that her legs are painted 3 times larger than her body in some panels."}]
