She gets them hooked on kissing/smelling her, puts chastity belts on them, and then tells them she'll let them coom... for money. The end result is that they all hate each other, they're sexually frustrated from not cooming for weeks on end, and they give all of their savings to Princess Hime when they finally do break. I haven't read part 1 in forever so some of the details are fuzzy, but the author puts a big emphasis on her not really giving a shit about her cosplay's source material (getting details wrong, etc.) but the otakus find her so hot that they end up not caring and giving her all the monies anyway"},{"id":2502909,"gallery_id":401726,"poster":{"id":3376326,"username":"Ulster","slug":"ulster","avatar_url":"avatars/3376326.png?_=7935f6c4b0214869","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1651675739,"body":"Ngl I don't even know what I'm looking at here"},{"id":2502641,"gallery_id":401726,"poster":{"id":4543468,"username":"Bruhpls","slug":"bruhpls","avatar_url":"avatars/4543468.png?_=159cc6bf38f9a7bc","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1651663885,"body":"Actually pretty good what the heck"}]
