Though I do like the few characters IN IT as characters....not as units in FE that DOEN'T have a World Map and EVEN WHEN THEY DO). Abel was better off with his boy \"Cain\" anyway. \"Bros before Hoes\" (Funny enough this at least gives some context to her ending in FE3, Poor Abel. Drop the slut and go back to your \"true love interest\".....Cain)"}]
