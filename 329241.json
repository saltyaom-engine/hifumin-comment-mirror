So far, from what I can make out is that MC is 28 yrs old no gf, his childhood friend is coming back from America to live in his apt for 3 months.

I haven't found the raws yet so I can't tell beyond what we are reading here so it's too early to say if there'd be any NTR/etc that you guys might wanna avoid."},{"id":1216677,"gallery_id":329241,"poster":{"id":3363847,"username":"zombieadd","slug":"zombieadd","avatar_url":"avatars/3363847.png?_=87136af99411069a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1600374688,"body":"One of the English titles is called 'Between Us' (toonily-alike site, check out webtoons(dot)xyz, alright nhentai pls don't ban me). \"Happy time?\" LOL"},{"id":1216648,"gallery_id":329241,"poster":{"id":842267,"username":"NevrGonaGivUup","slug":"nevrgonagivuup","avatar_url":"avatars/842267.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1600373544,"body":"This isn't japanese, it's chinese."},{"id":1216492,"gallery_id":329241,"poster":{"id":1989077,"username":"mathcar","slug":"mathcar","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1600366040,"body":"english does anyone know"}]
