Like the ending to this could and would make for an interesting follow up. Like (What if Yami did end up pregnant? how would her character change? What would all the other girls think or possibly do.) lol If I could draw my story would be similar to this but more emphasis on the future, pregnancy and how the girls would act on that news I would also keep all the girls personalities 90% the same as the anime/manga.
