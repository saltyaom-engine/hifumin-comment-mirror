Either way, I saw this on shimajis pixiv a couple months ago and noticed it was NTR, so I was at least not taken by surprise...just disappointed. Mind you I don\u2019t hate NTR fans (unless their dickheads like the house dude) and I don\u2019t think NTR should be annihilated, it\u2019s just not my thing and I would\u2019ve preferred this not being NTR, or at least not hard NTR. I\u2019m pretty fine with soft NTR honestly, but hard NTR- stuff like this, where a large emphasis is put on the dude watching, suffering, and crying...I just can\u2019t block it out enough to *use* it. Hats off to the people who can I guess, some really good artists do hard NTR, so y\u2019all got tons of content. "}]
