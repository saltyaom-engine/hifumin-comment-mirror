I can accept that they would keep regular water guns on board, as I would expect from a high school based anime, but to have to go through the effort of making them strong enough as to effectively fire goop with considerable range and pressure through a freaking pin hole designed for a liquid known for it's tendency to go though tiny gaps. AND EVEN THEN, water is hard enough to get though those things with even the slightest amount of accuracy, so either they made a huge mess with those outside of the intended target zone or specifically designed them to use some kind of pressurization mechanism, further making a point to the amount of useless effort they're putting towards their government decisions"},{"id":761755,"gallery_id":256368,"poster":{"id":1555461,"username":"MadKings","slug":"madkings","avatar_url":"avatars/1555461.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1545384979,"body":"I am Fourth "},{"id":761460,"gallery_id":256368,"poster":{"id":1829150,"username":"DominusKarma","slug":"dominuskarma","avatar_url":"avatars/1829150.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1545349745,"body":"Ok then\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"id":761351,"gallery_id":256368,"poster":{"id":1119977,"username":"Azza909","slug":"azza909","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1545339645,"body":"well ya gotta do something at sea to get rid of the stress lmao"},{"id":761280,"gallery_id":256368,"poster":{"id":322314,"username":"Olive Wing","slug":"olive-wing","avatar_url":"avatars/322314.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1545333737,"body":"Ok just... wtf"}]
