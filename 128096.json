She's not too keen on it and repeatedly tells him to just not visit her out of fear of bringing misfortune to him (the guy refers to her as a goddess). He eventually gets the courage to pay her a nightly visit, and Hina reveals she's very lonely and very insecure about herself (\"Even though you call me a goddess, I'm more like a youkai. I'm also really bad at conversation, am way older than you and am fat on top of that.\"). Then we learn the reason she opened up was because she was drunk. Protag declares that he loves Hina and states that if his being human is a problem, then he'll figure out a way to become a god just so that he can be with her (\"And once I succeed in becoming a god, we'll get married!\"). Hina tells him that's not something he can just declare (alluding that it's impossible) but tells him she'll be waiting for him."},{"id":1523395,"gallery_id":128096,"poster":{"id":2550763,"username":"\u305f\u3060\u306e\u4eba\u9593","slug":"tadanoren-jian","avatar_url":"avatars/2550763.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611473999,"body":"I couldn\u2019t read it but I could FEEL the sweetness in it.
