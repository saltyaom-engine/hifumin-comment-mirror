It's TinkerBell.  My soul is not ready.  Prepare for nipple-fucking, bug-laying, uterus-stretching and a terrible, horrible, depression-fueled ending.  DO NOT be fooled by the innocuous/innocent start.  TinkerBell doujins only end one way, with a girl giving birth to bugs out of her breasts, pussy, and asshole, completely mindbroken.  They will not be saved.  There is no hope.  Abandon all hope ye who enter this doujin!\r\n\r\nThen again, if you like that kind of thing, continue on!"}]
