If you consume it then there's a high chance that you have the same expectations in real life. That's why we have ppl like you trying to mask it as \"not a big deal\". I can hope that the majority know how to separate the two but that's not how the human mind works especially not if you condition yourself that way and we have plenty of weirdos who can't get a woman for that reason. How's it working out for Japan? low reproduction rate and an ageing population. No woman wants dudes with screwed up sexual expectations.

He asks Saku (Rika's other sex advisor, the one she had raw sex w/ in the car last chapter) that he'll call them again when he wants another 'party.'
