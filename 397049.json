Her new client is a woman who found evidence of her husband Shun cheating on her. After that she couldn't get in touch w/ him. She wants to divorce as soon as possible, they weren't having sex nor have kids anyways. FMC thinks it's similar to her past situation & asks to look at the evidence, it's a black mask & his phone. She finds videos of herself & that time at the orgy party. PTSD seems to kick in. FMC admits that this woman is her to her client who's confused.

She dies her hair blond too. Four months later she meets up w/ Saku again. They catch up a little. Saku's gotten a new part-time job. FMC said she went back to her old place to grab some things & found divorce papers. Divorce was hard on her, she couldn't do anything about it. She had hoped she could go back to the way things were, peaceful days. Maybe it was all an illusion. Saku says that's not true, her love was real. Both of them have changed.

But bc of Shun's tactics she ended up cheating on him. Shun remarks that Saku's been a good advisor to FMC; he snidely says it's certainly diff from his hypocritical lifestyle of cumming inside another man's wife. He looks forward to contacting them again. Toma comments that there's scumbags like Shun out there but basically it's not their job to worry about that sort of thing. Toma says that Saku worries too much & that he can't cut it as a 'sex advisor.' It'll only get harder for him from here on out.\n\nFMC wakes up, throws up, & tries to look for her pill to take after the orgy but Shun comes in to have his way w/ her again (just like in a previous chapter), but FMC mistakes him for someone else.

She's drinking her sorrows away w/ random men while letting them have their way. Then Toma (one of Rika's sex advisors) lets in a masked man who he calls 'S-san' & his group in, they begin to get rough w/ her including asphixiation, she calls to Shun to save her as they get into a large orgy w/ her.\n\nS-san takes off his mask & it turns out to be Shun himself. He asks Saku (Rika's other sex advisor, the one she had raw sex w/ in the car last chapter) that he'll call them again when he wants another 'party.' He explains his situation: basically he let FMC escalate into this situation bc the excitement/lust was gone to him, as a wife. FMC would be wasted on him only. It doesn't matter what his attitude on this situation is, as to him it's just sex & he wanted to make her into a woman that he could lust for once again."},{"id":2461813,"gallery_id":397049,"poster":{"id":4354264,"username":"Whore4men","slug":"whore4men","avatar_url":"avatars/4354264.png?_=4c3365bdecabc168","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1650095492,"body":"Uh?
