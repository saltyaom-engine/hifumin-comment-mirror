MHA gets posted less and less and the ones that are posted are either gay trash or just trash. other series that are amazing for doujin dont get touched like fairy tail one piece etc and again those that are tend to be garbage. the quality gets lower and lower. main reason why im more into fanfics than doujin. and even then not many good ones exist."}]
