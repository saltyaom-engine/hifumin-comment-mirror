Not that hard to understand, it's literally in the name.\nThis is different to a girl as they:\n1. Usually grew up 100% male, both in personality, and often, in genitals.\n2. Don't have boobs, a feminine voice, etc.\n3. Sometimes still have a penis.\n4. Definitely identify as male.\nIt's quite niche since it's similar to futas, but less popular since most people who are into the \"gender but with different genitals\" are usually just into women more than men. But I mean, if you wanna fuck a guy and don't wanna put it in the poop-chute, cuntboys are the option I suppose?\n\n(PS: Sometimes they're lumped in with the trans male/FTM category, too. Though it's about 50/50 from what I've seen.)"},{"id":1221329,"gallery_id":329480,"poster":{"id":1836094,"username":"i read it for the story","slug":"i-read-it-for-the-story","avatar_url":"avatars/1836094.png?_=73663ed2995de676","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1600593118,"body":"No, seriously.
