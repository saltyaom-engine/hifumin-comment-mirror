This is especially pronounced if the one in question is of other sex. This is strictly my opinion, but judging someone's morals is paradoxical in itself, simply because your tools for it are morals that can be just as wrong. Trying to correct them is kind of pointless anyways, as they will just screech at you for being an sjw, or otherwise scapegoat their way out. But as long as they don't pass all the unnecessary hate to their children, not much real harm is done. Thankfully we (mostly) live in a world in which women no longer need to put up with such bullshit, so naturally these kind of takes will be weeded out.

Oddly enough, the public's reaction to the crime is the same as this commen't section: claiming no actual abuse took place; the victim was in fact, compliant, despite being an elementary schooler.

Translator here. If you like what you see, please do be sure to follow the artist on pixiv and consider purchasing their doujin through official retailers. He sells all his works for only 500 yen (about $5). This one was his darkest by far, but his other works are worth checking out too. Links provided in the credits page. My socials can be found there as well, and I post updates when I can. Next work is gonna be a commissioned release, so please look forward to it."},{"id":2227397,"gallery_id":385386,"poster":{"id":2735367,"username":"Yukimono","slug":"yukimono","avatar_url":"avatars/2735367.png?_=ee6aa266c5d24d19","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640708977,"body":"the story is shit and the art is shit as well"},{"id":2227353,"gallery_id":385386,"poster":{"id":3410506,"username":"XV71","slug":"xv71","avatar_url":"avatars/3410506.png?_=42d7cb99aecd5372","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640708063,"body":"sick fucks"},{"id":2227196,"gallery_id":385386,"poster":{"id":4747215,"username":"Man who sold the world","slug":"man-who-sold-the-world","avatar_url":"avatars/4747215.png?_=d6fb444dceecdf7a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640703480,"body":"Wow, I don't know what to say."}]
