I think Katsura Airi is an entertaining writer and her characterizations are interesting and above average, but I still don\u2019t trust her to not drive this story somewhere really nihilistic and unsatisfying. My generic guess for where this plot goes next is that Fujisake convinces Ichinose to let him meet/seduce Mika, and he mindbreaks her with BDSM or some shit. Takenaka tries to separate her from the other men but fails and eventually gets removed from the story by some plot device. The clueless husband continues picking his nose somewhere off-screen.

Also 99% chance this new guy will also fuck Mika cause rn shes basically a cum sponge. I feel like this is how its gonna go down the husband finds out he flips breaks down dispairs leaves her and she will also go into dispair cause she although her body is like that maybe her heart still belonged to him and thats were ichinose also realizes all the fucked up shit he did to gain nothing not even her affection. And seeing how the junior geniunely has feelings for her he will probably accept her and end up with her in the end cause i mean rn even though he has feelings for her hes down to fuck her with another dude.

I just want to know if Ichinose has real romantic feelings for her, or if he is merely a typical NTR sex fiend villain\u2026 I also wonder how much he is projecting his unresolved mommy issues onto her, trying to conquer the heart of a woman who doesn't want him.

I hate that we are almost inevitably going to see Mika have sex with this new skeezy looking Fujisake guy. Anyway, I still can't really understand Ichinose's incentive for having her sleep with Takenaka. At first I thought it was a hotwifing thing, like he enjoyed showing her off to another guy as his sex toy and he was too confident to be jealous/possessive or threatened by a junior. He also seems a little bisexually hedonistic. But this line about trying to \"numb\" her and his refusal to let Fujisake meet her makes me wonder if there is more to it.
