It just doesn't know what to do with it. Likewise, neither do we. Ask almost any person with GID, that if offered a pill that miraculously made their gender align with their sex, most would take it - myself included. Because having those two facets of your person aligned, means the pain *goes away*. That's truly what we want, not to trick you or delve into perverse lusts... we just want to stop hurting.

And I'm a little perturbed by some of yall's opinions, especially since this is a HENTAI. I mean, c'mon, there is way weirder stuff here. Sooo, perhaps I should answer a few questions. Sex and Gender are not the same thing. Sex is determined by genetic code (most of the time, there are outliers; see 'intersex'). Gender is determined by what hormones are received at what time during fetal development - some of which come from the mother! A specific region of the brain is responsible for a person's gender identity, and while it may sound odd, the 'color' (or darkness/lightness) of this region is the only known way of empirically identifying a person's gender. Unfortunately this region is on the interior of the brain, so only corpses can be identified this way. That's why it's so 'wishy washy' as there's no clear indicator we can see.
