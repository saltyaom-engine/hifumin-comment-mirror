Ofc I can't force Uru to start making that type of hentai, but I feel that it would really work. My reason for that is his coffee break illustrations which really pop and look cute. Beyond that, I really dislike guro and snuff, vore is only tolerable to me at rare times and Uru has definitely made something that has effectively made me hate this murderous elf, but I didn't come to nhentai to watch murder and hate the mc. It's a shame to me too, I really like Uru's art and would become a fan if he/she was interested in drawing something other than snuff, guro, vore, giantess hentai. Right now, I can't say that I enjoy Uru or his/her work."},{"id":391093,"gallery_id":228096,"poster":{"id":402047,"username":"Virus123","slug":"virus123","avatar_url":"avatars/402047.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1521693082,"body":"I must say this is quite odd but I like it for some reason.
