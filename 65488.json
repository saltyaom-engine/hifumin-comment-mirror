You may ask, well, it's how short and straight-forward every situation is, how short they are is pretty nice and easy reading; MiniMimi comes with 6-7 histories which are pretty unique in their own way (except Momo's parts). How every drawing looks cute and everything on it just melts lewdness and sweetness is amazing, plus, there are lolis for every like! So it's kind of a plus. Amazing work, good artwork."}]
