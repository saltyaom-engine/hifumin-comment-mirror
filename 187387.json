certainly are cases where this applies, be it because the adult actually is an ass without regard to the wellbeing of the child or because the adult is wellmeaning but is not careful enough to recognize his own great influence over the child and the subtle signals that it would rather not be doing this. now as to arguments against this stance, we know from psychological research since quite

the origins of the term, you could read it up on wikipedia. so a loli is a girl that is out of infancy but has not hit puberty yet, sometimes people use the term to refer to sexualized depictions only
