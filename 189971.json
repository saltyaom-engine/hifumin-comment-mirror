I think the disgusting fat guy is a way to show either the artist's or the target public hatred against the type of women they consider inadequate.\r\n\r\nShow I agree with the general opinion against over competitive and megalomaniac individuals, going to sexual assault is even worse, and putting the gender of the \"targets\" into focus is a way to spread sexist opinions, which should never be, even using artistic licenses.\r\n\r\nThere's \"descent\" histories (truth be told, this does NOT turn on me at all) involving  violence at different levels, like for example \"I ran into bandits in the forest and got raped\" (kinda stupid title, right?).
