After Ota-kun's confession of love to Miyo (the love crazy girl) these two fix their \"relationship\". And in theory she loves him, in the weird way of her, but still has drawbacks because he is a nerd lol also later joins the friendship Maria (the blonde gal), but the two do not get along. The author does not make it clear if he will develop their relationship in the future, he leaves as a precedent that Miyo finds out that the other two had sex, for which he feels more hostility towards Maria. I think it is more than clear that a sequel will arrive but we will have to wait, I just hope that we should not wait a little more than two years like the last time hahaha also it was its first sequel so I think it will continue. >>>link: https://yassoooon.fanbox.cc/posts/2549820?utm_campaign=manage_post_page&utm_medium=share&utm_source=twitter"},{"id":1915151,"gallery_id":367826,"poster":{"id":4069858,"username":"The Mischievous Gentleman","slug":"the-mischievous-gentleman","avatar_url":"avatars/4069858.png?_=1862f47404851cef","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1627872801,"body":"Very nice \ud83d\ude42"},{"id":1915086,"gallery_id":367826,"poster":{"id":3588418,"username":"Stck","slug":"stck","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1627871196,"body":"Damn still no sequel to the series about the love crazy girl and the nerdy guy at the train station who gets trained in sex by the blonde gal. The love crazy girl just wanted the guy to confess to her, and at the end of the second one he did exactly that, so it should be a happy ending - but it would be nice to actually see"}]
