Five whole decensored tankubons filled to the brim with delicious vanilla goodness. No rape, no netorare, no cheating, no bullshit. Plus that art style is aces, cause Dr.P understands volume. Even the petite girls have curves in all the right places and indentations where their underwear presses against the skin, and it only gets better with the voluptuous ladies; Dr. P knows how to draw an ass to die for.\n\nShiwasu no Oknia's 'Pisu Hame' is great, right up until all the rape. Yamatogawa has the same problem in 'Witchcraft' and 'Power Play'. Ditto with Yukimi's 'Birthday' and 'Kano Bana'. I'd be hard pressed to name anyone else with as long and as consistent a track-record of sublime vanilla, combined with a gorgeous art aesthetic, as Dr.P has.\n\n11/10 - This tankubon gave me Diabeetus."}]
