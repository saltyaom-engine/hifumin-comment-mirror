Can anyone explain what happened at the ending? I got kinda confused. My guess is that Satoru wasn\u2019t actually in love with Gaku because in one of the last panels he said \u201cFrom now on we\u2019ll be together forever sensei\u201d. So maybe he was doing the same as Gaku, but instead of luring little girls to his brother he lures little boys to that sensei person? It would make sense because in the last panel you can see Gaku is missing. So maybe that was what he meant with \u201ccuring loneliness\u201d Jesus that fucked up lol."},{"id":1067397,"gallery_id":291664,"poster":{"id":1337645,"username":"Kenny Omega","slug":"kenny-omega","avatar_url":"avatars/1337645.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594322206,"body":"Chale que loco"}]
