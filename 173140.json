First of all, is this NTR? Yeah, I think so. We don\u2019t need to have such a narrow definition. Since, in my opinion, a loved one was stolen away from the male protagonist, that counts as NTR. It would have been easier to classify this as NTR if the male protagonist was married to the woman or be his girlfriend, BUT it need not always be the case. Again NTR isn't just between established couples when it comes to hentai and such... it also pertains to strongly Potential couples/Chilhoodfriends/Love ones/Familly members/etc...ie...a couple that WOULD have ended up together if the douche didn't come out of nowhere and literally rape the girl away from the guy."},{"id":60640,"gallery_id":173140,"poster":{"id":20748,"username":"thatrandomanon","slug":"thatrandomanon","avatar_url":"avatars/20748.png?_=541f9c883602c6bc","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1473307649,"body":"this is not a NTR you fucking idiots"},{"id":60448,"gallery_id":173140,"poster":{"id":237705,"username":"Metroid old account","slug":"metroid-old-account","avatar_url":"avatars/237705.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1473209858,"body":"Lets hope that Yuzuki's next ntr work would be more like Another World rather than this"},{"id":60444,"gallery_id":173140,"poster":{"id":714946,"username":"Troncol","slug":"troncol","avatar_url":"avatars/714946.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1473208506,"body":"@memekudapat - You forgot to add to the end Setsuna making the Peace sign + Ahegao to send off Gin-chan...
