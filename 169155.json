Its a fictional scenario in a fictional world with fictional characters. Its like how people say anyone that reads loli hentai is a pedophile, no, they don't go around molesting children, they know the difference between reality and fantasy. If you start trying to adhere laws to fictional works, every author that has ever written a rape or murder should be thrown in jail. God, George R.R. Martin will probably get the death penalty. Hell, even J.K. Rowling is guilty. People need to appreciate that fantasy does not mean you need to directly influence it into reality."},{"id":53294,"gallery_id":169155,"poster":{"id":325845,"username":"Twillij","slug":"twillij","avatar_url":"avatars/325845.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1468782179,"body":"How is this even remotely acceptable? o_O"},{"id":53257,"gallery_id":169155,"poster":{"id":471359,"username":"jayday","slug":"jayday","avatar_url":"avatars/471359.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1468764966,"body":"Navel fuck scene makes me think of \" August Underground's Mordum\".
