Firstly it's not really much of an escalation, I don't see how having sex with strangers in a restroom is more corrupted than having sex with monster dogs and tentacles, it might have made sense if it caused her crush to see her true face, but that plot point was kinda dropped. Then like I don't even know what to make about the end, she gives birth to a demon baby so that scientist can continue their race, but then the baby like holds up an orb that \"rejects\" both of them, which ended up killing the scientist and the baby? Then she snaps out of the mind break and buries them? \n\nIs there some Japanese lore I need to make sense of this?
