It's described in the LN, when Lillia and Paul were younger, studying sword together, Paul rape Lillia (kinda halfway because she had a crush on him). After that she got injured, and started to work as maid for some royal people, whose end up having some... \"hardcore fetish\" (??) I don't remember if she got raped there too, but almost... I'm reading the manga, but I have readed all the LN too, and between those are a lot of difference.
