Like no shit it\u2019s low quality, we can clearly see that. It\u2019s still a fantastic Doujin, and I can still get off to it just fine. It would just be nice to not have parts of each page obscured by obnoxious text. Is there a higher quality version of this? If so, can someone please upload it?"}]
