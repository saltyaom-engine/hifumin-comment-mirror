I really wished this would be translated because there's so little Ayame Doujin and rarer are Ayame doujins that have plotlines like this and with riku involved.\n\nI severely doubt this would be translated though considering that doujins from this artist seems to be not translated always and the one's that are, well the other doujin that i wanted translated took 2 years to be translated into english and that was doujin from F/GO which is really really popular. \n\nWhat are the chances of this doujin getting translated when build divers is more obscure in comparison to it and not to mention this was already made 2 years ago and only now just posted here. I'm more likely to win the Lottery than see this doujin translated into English anytime soon."}]
