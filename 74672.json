Everyone is in love with the wrong person, the MC loves a boy who loves his childhood friend and sees the MC as only a smut buddy. The club adviser sees everyone as just a fuck buddy but doesn't otherwise give a shit about them. The MC has a boy who loves him but he refuses to see it because of his sexual addiction to the other boy. The whole thing is a love triangle with girly boys. Kind of entertaining but also frustrating too."}]
