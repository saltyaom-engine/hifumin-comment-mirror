Not much story into the individual personalities. Only whatever was there in the main story dialogues and base conversations... Therefore, can't really say that I like any of these females nor much care for them outside of their appearance designs. Only girl for me was Nagi sadly and even she had barely anything going for her backstory as well.  It feels like the only people to actually give these chars actual personalities or stories are the fan themselves... Quite sad...\nPerhaps they will try better next time when they remake it again?"}]
