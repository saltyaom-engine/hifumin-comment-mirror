Some solid stories and art but some of the best (hayake, Maeshima Ryo, and that one set at the school sex club mostly) got cut short IMO. Also wtf Maeshima Ryo decided they wanted to make an Ichihaya ending, I can truly say I never thought they\u2019d do something like this, at least not in LO; can\u2019t say I\u2019m a fan either tbh. Anyway,  an average 5-6, I need to review the stories a couple more times before I can definitively say or not. Hope y\u2019all can enjoy at least 1-2 of the stories, see y\u2019all next month.
