There are at least 20-30 hot girls in it. Also(I'm a guy and am not gay but) the guys look pretty fine as well, it's probably one of the best materials for doujins. Plus the whole magic system, It even has multiple forms of creation magic. And that fake son of zeref guy(the white dragneel I think) literally use magic that was called 'pleasure' and it was like a combination of pain and 'forbidden pleasure' and he even had a tentacle version of it that he could use on specific people that felt even better.
