What I really didn't get is why it was important for the purple hair fairy to be alive for the impure ones. We never got an answer to that. I could assume she would give birth the impure king maybe? Since it ends here and it doesn't have any sequels, I suppose we won't get any answers. Oh well, quite interesting plot and good art too. 4,5/5 is my rating.
