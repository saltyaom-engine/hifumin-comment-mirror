And that's a conflict originating from you trying to analyze a fetish that you don't possess. In this particular hentai manga, it should be fairly obvious that the two discussed terms and \"safe words\" before the activity occurred. Of course in this manga it's not as obvious. Firstly, it's fiction. Secondly, it's because in a submissive's mind; an \"scene\" where there are no ways out or to fight is ideal. (Usually until they get to the actually \"doing\" of course. That's why you use safe words.) I'm not really sure if you've caught this as well, but the male S is aroused by the events unfolding before his eyes, even if he does not express it as such. A gigantic aspect of the BDSM community is achieving pleasure/pain from flesh, but the mental torment as well. Again, that sort of play is not understood by individual's who do not engage in such activities. So read the tags and lay off the shit for those who want to read."},{"id":87376,"gallery_id":180879,"poster":{"id":950435,"username":"Rabbit_Lights","slug":"rabbit_lights","avatar_url":"avatars/950435.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1485234573,"body":"LOL, wow OK, this comment thread is a fucking trainwreck. I'm gunna to split my rebuttal into two pieces and address two issues that you guys have gotten seriously twisted or wrong. Let's first go with the overall treatment of the male submissives:\r\n\r\nThis is a work of fiction. Fiction means exaggerated and unrealistic perceptions of true events. This was illustrated by a male author that clearly knows what his wants are, and what his desired audience wants. If you guys think that crushing a man's testicles or keeping him as a slave is ethical or anywhere near reality, you need the ultimate bitchslap of truth.\r\nThis entire manga takes place within the \"scene\": an artificial reality/play where the author illustrates his ideal utopia. If this is an fetish that an submissive possesses, then who the fuck are the rest of you to judge him/her and the doms they place within this scene? If none of you possess a \"love-them-use-them\" fetish then it's stupid and pointless to try and understand."},{"id":87167,"gallery_id":180879,"poster":{"id":493354,"username":"bubbletehh","slug":"bubbletehh","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1485156400,"body":"I realise the ntr would turn some people on and all but it was really quite unnecessary, I've never felt this way (disgust at the female lead) about a femdom hentai before so I guess the author gets a plus for that.
