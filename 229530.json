This anthology doujin is kinda meh, soranosuzume, kaeru and nokoppa are the only one's standing out, the rest are just simple and not trying to improve their overall, I'm feeling a 6 on this anthology."},{"id":414032,"gallery_id":229530,"poster":{"id":25571,"username":"Frozzy","slug":"frozzy","avatar_url":"avatars/25571.png?_=738fe647d8f406fe","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1523137929,"body":"hanamaki kaeru's art looked a bit better in this one. he needs to improve more. nokoppa should just do more yaoi overall i like it when he/she does.
