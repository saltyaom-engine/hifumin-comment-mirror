A lot are... incredibly xenophobic. I don't know the psychology at work here, but them having a fictional race which is western and elitist and xenophobic themselves that they can use as a proxy without really offending anyone (at least when the Japanese are xenophobic, they tend to be \"polite\" about it). Sorta like how in Star Trek the Klingons were a stand-in for the Soviet Union. Why catgirls are so enamored and respected in Japan, however, is beyond me. I think it would have to do with a lot of yokai mythology involving cats and cat women/shapeshifters to begin with. \n\nInteresting note tangentially related note: there is not a single piece of indigenous vampire mythology in Japan that can't be traced to western influence. \"Land of the Rising Sun,\" eh?

This include a lot of japanese people, too. And I'm not talkin about pedo, criminal, ecc. I'm talking about normal people: they hate the ainu (people of the extreme nord of japan), burakumin (whose only sin is to have a grandparent or more distant that worked with dead/death/blood. this include hunter), ryukyuan (people of extreme island near korea), all the naturalized immigrant and their descendant (children of  gaijin). F**k, they hate people full stop: as far as I know, italian like myself are hated because: 1)we are all \"casanova\" (womanizer) 2)we like to shake hand on first encounter 3) we call each other with name instead of surname. I think step two and three apply to most non asiatic country too. Step one too, but such credence is diffused in Japan only for Italy, America (less womanizer more sex fiend/libertine) and Great Britain."},{"id":346531,"gallery_id":217642,"poster":{"id":556903,"username":"sparkling007","slug":"sparkling007","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1515404443,"body":"chinese please"},{"id":339640,"gallery_id":217642,"poster":{"id":190041,"username":"ricoken","slug":"ricoken","avatar_url":"avatars/190041.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1514308626,"body":"hmm neferpitou looks old in this one"},{"id":338102,"gallery_id":217642,"poster":{"id":739912,"username":"zerorider11","slug":"zerorider11","avatar_url":"avatars/739912.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1514000512,"body":"I began suspecting japanese people has a strong hate on elves, more stronger than their hate to China...
