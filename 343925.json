Believe it or not you can have romantic relationship with someone even if they cuck you and have no desire to leave you/go with the other person. There is a few manga like that, that get the NTR tag, but the relationship is a stable, yet kinky one. No one is being stolen. There is the NTR type that is \"willingly sharing your partner\", which is close, but that still ends with them usually choosing the new person over their old lover. Hence cuck should get its own tag for when its something all parties want, but the original relationship remains intact"},{"id":1487491,"gallery_id":343925,"poster":{"id":2824147,"username":"Emiru Ikuno","slug":"emiru-ikuno","avatar_url":"avatars/2824147.png?_=d024fc5a08fab09c","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1610640526,"body":"When i saw tooth brushing, i thought of that one anime scene.
