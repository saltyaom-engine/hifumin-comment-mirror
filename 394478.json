As he has gentle sex with her, he tells her not to apologize or have a guilty conscience when she's feeling this good. Eventually, she starts to break and tells him to stop, or something will snap inside her. She tightens around Coach and he does her harder.

She responds that it's loungewear. Coach says it looks great on her. She wants to take it off before it gets dirty, but Coach says it's fine and to keep it on until she stops crying. He then asks her where it hurts, and touches her all over her body, tracing her painful parts, like he's plugging holes. It feels weird to her. She notes that her switch can turn on and off, but it's a little scary, and that she feels good, but also guilty. She tells Coach that he doesn't want him to be gentle, and he says that she's definitely different than usual today. He says that if he's too rough, her fragile clothes might tear. She disagrees and tells him to use her like his \"thing\", like always. He says he *is* doing her like always, how he wants to do her. He notes that her pussy is more sensitive and tries to finger her, but Yuki stops him and says that her clothes are important.

He wishes that every time they spoke, time could stop for an hour, because that might enough for him to come up with a tasteful reply, but even if you added up all of the time on their way home, it was still less than an hour, and that's been the distance between him and Yuki for all of their daily lives. He tells her not to worry about it, and that he was just doing his own thing. He tells her that everyone else thinks of Yuki as a friend. She asks what he thinks of her.

Throughout this, Shoma and Niimi grow closer as Coach and Yuki grow more intimate. Shoma wonders why talking to Niimi makes him feel nostalgic, while Yuki reflects on the fact that she and Shoma did not exchange a single word over summer break. One day, everyone throws Yuki a surprise party as a general thank you for all her hard work and her birthday. She asks who told them about her birthday; Himeko says it was Shoma. They give her a fluffy jacket and shorts as a present, and a matching wristband that everyone else is wearing. This, too, was Shoma's idea. Yuki thanks him, making it the first time they've spoken in months. She watches as Shoma serves Niimi peach juice, but Niimi insists on helping Shoma too. Yuki remarks that she thought Shoma hated peach juice, but Shoma implies that he's changed his mind now.
