You know, 63+% of women have regular rape fantasies (where they are the victim.)  I'm guessing a minority of ladies have have fantasies about being the rapist, too. Recent research (well 2012)  points to women being \"rapey\" at about 40%, while men are around 60%.  Honestly I have a hard time believing it is that high in women, even though I'm technically a rape \"survivor\" of one.   After that happened I began to fetishize Femdom type stuff.  Mostly cause I couldn't talk about with anybody (the first few attempts I made were completely humiliating. And not in a good way.)
