I can almost remember the day that I had laid my eyes on the work of this artist. It was for just this work of art that I had created this account, to favorite this work of art and make sure that at least one more person is able to witness life changing art. The eloquence of this author is quite immaculate. Every single part of this story has been incredible. There is a great sense of reality to each and every character and their personalities are unique and beautiful. It truly captures the beauty of childhood innocence while emphasizing the merit of childhood romance. That is even before mentioning the beautiful, immaculate art that perfectly reflects  the nature of the plot. This is truly a work of art that deserves to be shown in schools, to display the healthiness of a great relationship, to inspire people to work their hardest.
