He says was given to a girl he used to be in love with, but various things happened and they broke up. He gets asked if he's still hung up on her, but he says no, it was a story from long ago, and she probably doesn't even remember him anymore, but it's fine that way. It ends with an internal monologue saying \"Charlotte, you might not be by my side anymore, but I'll keep protecting the world you live in.\"\n\nSo, in some respects he's moved on from her, but in others not really.
