Then again, it seems more like it's based on time spent able to transform, given that Mana went to Rikka's, meaning she was either fighting solo or wasn't fighting at all (though I won't fully dismiss the idea that she might have transformed for something mundane), so if it's not the above or different \"aptitudes\" and an absurd coincidence, I've got nothing."},{"id":1366909,"gallery_id":102662,"poster":{"id":2989296,"username":"The God of Procrastination","slug":"the-god-of-procrastination","avatar_url":"avatars/2989296.png?_=97be02e333d2749c","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1606514840,"body":"It needs washing, under the foreskin if applicable.
