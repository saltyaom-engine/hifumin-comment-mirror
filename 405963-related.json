I could dir from happiness and fapping for too hard and yet here I am counting everyday to the release of another new chapter and this bullshit is all I get T.T . Fuck do I have to do now, back to fapping to all those teasing scenes of no actual NTR with the power of imagination?

Like what you said about horror movies, I love them too but I never see things in the POV of the MC nor the killer, I enjoy them as an audience who doesn\u2019t involve in any of the stuff like a bystander . But it\u2019s another story if it\u2019s any other media that I consume beside fapping, it\u2019s a big fuck NO NTR, I stay far fucking away from that shit because I do feel for the MC when it comes to normal entertainment that\u2019s not purely for the libido loll.

You can say that I read exclusively NTR hentai and most of the time I don\u2019t even bother reading other genre at all. I can say that I read them for the thrill and excitement from all the hidden sex and the struggle of the Female protagonist fighting herself and the guys who force her when she can\u2019t decide if she actually want to cheat or not. Most of the time if an NTR lack one of the two element, it\u2019s automatically a bad NTR for me. If it has both 2 elements then it\u2019s considered one of the best in the hall of fame of NTR hentai for me. The first time I experience NTR is from Berserk, I actually hated sooo much. But idk why later on the more I hated it the more I wanna read it lol. And no I never read or watch or accept even a tiny bit of NTR stuff on any other than the type of media that\u2019s not used for fapping."},{"id":2574946,"gallery_id":405963,"poster":{"id":1037380,"username":"sonofshiva","slug":"sonofshiva","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1654594190,"body":"Man god damn! I bet you guys 100% it\u2019s the MC in the last page. So we\u2019re still not getting any NTR yetttt. Damn it! At this point idk if this series is ever gonna get actual NTR at all or maybe it\u2019s just gonna be teasing till the end guys! Mannn, I was so hype for this chapter and this series overall to be one of the best NTR series out there and here it is, still disappointment. I don\u2019t think real NTR gonna happen anytime soon, if it does then I don\u2019t think we gonna have to wait at least another year for it to actually happen. So disappointed, sigh..  An author who\u2019s famous for his NTR works now does teasing both vanilla lovers and NTR lovers, fucking hell.

Just like when you play horror movies or watch tense movies, it makes you feel something you just can't experience anywhere else. Being scared isn't funny but we watch and play horror movies and games anyway for what they make us feel. Then why not read NTR, which is essentially the NSFW version of young girls' favorite romance stories? I rest my case.
