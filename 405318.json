Misaoka got his fat payout doing the cuck's commissioned comic for his generic story and pissed off most of his fans, so not shocking they arent doing much work lately. sakamata nerimono with some oppai loli rape thing, pass. Nishida Megane making what looks to be the gem in this one though. Good stuff overall. Not a fan of H9's stuff as said before. Its pretty fucking generic for that genre."},{"id":2566424,"gallery_id":405318,"poster":{"id":3363847,"username":"zombieadd","slug":"zombieadd","avatar_url":"avatars/3363847.png?_=87136af99411069a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1654209257,"body":"Another Kuro Gal story from Toba Yuga LET'S FUCKING GOOOO! Misaoka's only cover page? H9's series is getting kinda repetitive but with a milf taste. Now, something feels a little off at the end of the issue... there are no ads, so is this really complete? Just wondering..."}]
