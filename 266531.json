The contrast of treatment is stark: She is intimate with and forthcoming to the parasitic cuckoo, collaborating with him to their mutual advantage; simultaneously, she is cold to her husband and wholly intent on keeping him as adrift and unaware of the situation as possible so as to better make him a mule to be hemmed in and driven for someone else's benefit. That's what makes this better NTR than the possibility where he melodramatically discovers his wife and divorces her. The cuckoo knows more about his life and wife than he does and continues to come around the nest, the two disparage him together and he, without knowledge, is unable to extricate himself and start his own family."},{"id":854929,"gallery_id":266531,"poster":{"id":589379,"username":"The Blacklister","slug":"the-blacklister","avatar_url":"avatars/589379.png?_=b0def5a33b58a8a5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1553448611,"body":"...Almost every fuckin tank,story,doujin someone shit out to this fuckin site is fucking NTRASH.What the fuck is wrong with you people? -- MEMBER OF ANTI-NTRASH MOVEMENT --"},{"id":851957,"gallery_id":266531,"poster":{"id":363630,"username":"theprankster","slug":"theprankster","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1553190254,"body":"this genre needs to die"},{"id":851611,"gallery_id":266531,"poster":{"id":554965,"username":"croix","slug":"croix","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1553164909,"body":"happy ending"},{"id":850461,"gallery_id":266531,"poster":{"id":237705,"username":"Metroid old account","slug":"metroid-old-account","avatar_url":"avatars/237705.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1553048651,"body":"Translation of the first part https://hentai.cafe/manga/read/kaitenfude-barren-flower/en/0/1/page/1"},{"id":850448,"gallery_id":266531,"poster":{"id":625113,"username":"YaoiEmperor","slug":"yaoiemperor","avatar_url":"avatars/625113.png?_=08af0ee679a7b5b9","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1553047960,"body":"guys start complaining about NTR I can't get into mood without you"}]
