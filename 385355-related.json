This one ends in a more positive note because it becomes consensual while in the other he just uses that power of His to make the guy now girl fall in love with him in a love-hate relationship where she hates him for ruining her family and her childhood friend but can't resist mating with him. Stockholm with a hint of Lima. Loved how he was never in love with his tomboy friend so there was no NTR here. Especially when said a friend even corrupted still want to have sex with him simply out of a sense of entitlement to his virginity before the bombshell that he was never interested sexually in her no matter her body type or disposition dropped. I mean at least they're still good friends without the awkwardness now!"},{"id":2324528,"gallery_id":385355,"poster":{"id":742482,"username":"Mabo","slug":"mabo","avatar_url":"avatars/742482.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1644524591,"body":"For what it's worth... it surprisingly ends on a positive note.
