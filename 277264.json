The dialogue does seem pretty stiff and unnaturally formal, especially given the situation and characters (Tayuya's VERY informal, and does like to cuss). The sex scene could've been longer and more shown, since the last page seems to kinda rush things, and not show the entire love making. I do love how Tayuya seems to be happy here with her boyfriend, so that's pretty wholesome. \n\nOverall, 5/10, due to its untapped potential.
