He works in a host club because he thinks his ability can make him rich in such a place.\n One day he stumbles upon his idol, and conveniently offers him a ride to where the guy was headed to. The idol notices our MC knows him, and lightly hits on the MC.\nOur MC then goes to work, can't stop thinking about his idol, but still swears not to be gay. MC sends Idol a \"haha, I'm that guy from a few days ago, you free?\" message inviting him for dinner. It becomes obvious that MC is a lot into him. The idol then starts to have many kinky thoughts, which are all read by the MC, and that's it.\n Let's hope ch2 has some real action."},{"id":1200571,"gallery_id":328159,"poster":{"id":2476236,"username":"ThisDarkFujoshi","slug":"thisdarkfujoshi","avatar_url":"avatars/2476236.png?_=c73e438317adc283","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1599636940,"body":"I don\u2019t get what\u2019s going on, but I want more.
