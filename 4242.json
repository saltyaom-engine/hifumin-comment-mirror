Why would Kakashi molest a child and ask his student to rape a child?\n2. What's really dumb is why would Sasuke know how to rape a girl?\n3. Where did everyone suddenly come from when both Kakashi and Hinata were originally alone? \n4. Why would other students simply watch while Kakashi was molesting a helpless Hinata? \n5. Why is Kakashi only in charge of Hinata and not the rest of Kurenai's student just because Kurenai is on a mission?\n6. Really, Naruto of all people is happy to willingly rape a defenseless girl just to train when Hinata knows him better than anyone else?\nOf course it's a freaking hentai doujinshi, nothing would make sense."},{"id":778282,"gallery_id":4242,"poster":{"id":642166,"username":"Hhaziq98","slug":"hhaziq98","avatar_url":"avatars/642166.png?_=c80b386f00d7d34d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1546766659,"body":"So, it was rape in illusion after all?
