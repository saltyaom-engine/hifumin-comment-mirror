Let me get this straight though, the kid at the end is definitely Tsuyoshis though right? I mean its cool that despite being turned into a girl and getting fucked way too many times, that Midou decided to stay (at least sexually) as a guy. Still kind of a loop and a waste of character development."},{"id":1624911,"gallery_id":159167,"poster":{"id":477004,"username":"FresshLikeLettuce","slug":"fresshlikelettuce","avatar_url":"avatars/477004.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1616035625,"body":"wow so at the end of this chaos she decided to marry the hibary girl and  even she managed to get pregnant with Tsuyoshi's child   wow thats luck for you  at least she gave birth to a talented  she/male  after all Tsuyoshi a pretty damn good  basketball player ."},{"id":1382791,"gallery_id":159167,"poster":{"id":1052472,"username":"A Certain Crossdressing Touma","slug":"a-certain-crossdressing-touma","avatar_url":"avatars/1052472.png?_=0adb4fee00706545","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1607069792,"body":"Re-reading it but first comment here. Shizuku has two guys and one girl, and she (well, she stopped being a he since vol 1 lol) chose to elope(?) with the girl that she barely had any development with. Even two pieces of hate-sex and comfort-sex she had with Hiroyuki left more feelings than the sudden lesbian sex she had with Hibari. But oh well. And peeps, you should stop comment about feeling gay to these stories. We know of your insecurity, but there are nothing gay about loving a trans woman. (Just... she is more magically transformed than going through a real life SRS.)"},{"id":1178742,"gallery_id":159167,"poster":{"id":293537,"username":"HenYuri","slug":"henyuri","avatar_url":"avatars/293537.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1598699285,"body":"Dude I have several questions!"},{"id":98507,"gallery_id":159167,"poster":{"id":792911,"username":"That Guy 319","slug":"that-guy-319","avatar_url":"avatars/792911.png?_=230a595efe04ec92","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1489394556,"body":"Well this was a cluster f*ck of a story...btw the only ending that makes sense is Tsuyoshi and Midou getting together and raising their kid...since that's the only relationship with any type of development."},{"id":43721,"gallery_id":159167,"poster":{"id":378817,"username":"remos18","slug":"remos18","avatar_url":"avatars/378817.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1461986143,"body":"shit I just fapped to a guy"},{"id":40803,"gallery_id":159167,"poster":{"id":262969,"username":"wheelyfeely","slug":"wheelyfeely","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1458757951,"body":"I've never felt so gay reading the whole thing."}]
