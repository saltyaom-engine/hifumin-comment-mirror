When an update is made, someone updates the comic on SadPanda and deletes the old gallery there.\n\nBecause Nhentai works by mirroring all SadPanda galleries, and also does not delete any old galleries when they are updated, you see this comic re-uploaded a lot when a new page is added. Nhentai does not delete the old galleries.\n\nIt's a problem with Nhentai's system more than anything else."},{"id":1074970,"gallery_id":320221,"poster":{"id":2713103,"username":"DeMonMusuBoi","slug":"demonmusuboi","avatar_url":"avatars/2713103.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594596495,"body":"Does anyone have any clues as of why this comicbook get reuploaded every fucking week?
