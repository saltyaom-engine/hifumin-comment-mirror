Obviously such a thing couldn't just magically function without a power source, however that wasn't a problem when it was still working properly. So when the watch broke it overloaded, as we can see at how the arms of the watch turn fast. The overload caused a different effect, which means the time didn't stop for him, he was exiled from time, time continued on without him and only reappeared again when he fixed the watch (somehow with just tapes? Is that flex seal?), too bad for him it took tremendous amount of power just to bring him back to the plane of time. Bringing someone back requires more power than throwing them out, so as exchanged he prolly got his power sucked out, so he dried out.
