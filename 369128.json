You might think that he was talking about grtting back to the main force and you're correct. However, why would the author just put it in for no reason? So I deducted that he said it because he is under the hypnosis of Ravia. Imagine this, You're a soldier for your whole life but then you meet a suspicious girl on an unknown island.
