It is \"Gekiga (not really the title it means story/novel comic): Kachiku-jin yap\u016b\" (a short novel by Numa Sh\u014dz\u014d). It means \"Human Cattle Yapoo\" (which are the dehumanized Japanese people in the \"dystopian utopia\" of the masochistic author lol). Egawa Tessei also made a version of the same story."}]
