It's all good and all but my main issue is that the panels all look so damn alike!\n\nIf you scroll fast in overview mode you will see that your eyes will be unable to tell the difference between some panels.\n\nThis is due to the artist having too many of the same positions just rotated in the next panel. What i mean by this is that in one panel the head of a girl will be at 12 o' clock and in the next panel it will be at 1 o' clock.\nThis gives a good sense of movement that the reader's eyes can easily keep track of but makes all the panels look way too similar.\n\n+points for giving more attention to Wiz,which i find is somewhat rare in Kazuma art.\n\nAll in all if you can just learn to seperate the looks of one image strip from the other,your art will have great success!"},{"id":556888,"gallery_id":190936,"poster":{"id":1781212,"username":"KinkySuccubusDarkness","slug":"kinkysuccubusdarkness","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1529806088,"body":"Yay!
