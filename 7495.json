A lot of these works are older than the year they\u2019ve been posted and the artwork and style reflects that. It\u2019s also interesting to see what was considered attractive back then and now. Artists who\u2019ve been around for 10 or more years, you can see the development of their art. Personally I prefer the more modern stuff but curiosity has brought me back to the older stuff haha."},{"id":1091110,"gallery_id":7495,"poster":{"id":858169,"username":"belrog","slug":"belrog","avatar_url":"avatars/858169.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1595271560,"body":"Browsing through old works on this site feels strange man. Jyogi's art and the translation is so different is really reflect how far we've come. Back then when this was translated in 2006, censorship was so rampant in hentai and the climate of anime community back then was still a niche. And this work probably dated back way older than it is"},{"id":585357,"gallery_id":7495,"poster":{"id":919504,"username":"zeph tinder","slug":"zeph-tinder","avatar_url":"avatars/919504.png?_=c99ba03cb444ff1d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1533072459,"body":"that last scene... meh"}]
