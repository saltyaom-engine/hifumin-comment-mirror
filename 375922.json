Went as you saw and then rumors started due to them being too loud (pg 20) and it obviously reached the prince that said something like \"Your white is actually semen you slut\" and went back to his country. Tan guy then said \"We bribe the king and it's all good. No heads flying\", but then the king said \"Oh well shit happened so i'll get you 2 married and that's it\". Then they married, tan turned into king and they had that photo where they had this face like shit without even looking at each other (lmao). NTR? Kinda. Guess it falls more into netori, but thankfully since its Hara, it's rather soft/mild so that's that. Also i'm not so sure but i think it said that those 2 lived happy together so that's nice too"},{"id":2069024,"gallery_id":375922,"poster":{"id":263219,"username":"Unrecognized","slug":"unrecognized","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1633721127,"body":"\u7ed3\u5c40\u6709\u70b9\u6b27\u4ea8\u5229\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u4f1a\u51fa\u70b9\u5927\u4e8b\u513f\u4f46\u7a81\u7136\u5f88\u5e73\u6de1\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u4e86\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8"}]
