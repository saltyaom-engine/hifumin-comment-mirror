She struggled not to lose her little brother, but in the end she still lost him. Apparently this story fills in the gaps of the other story titled \"Hand\" and a prequel to \"Another World\", but focuses more on the unlucky big sister. It tells some small details like how she lost her virginity by prostituting to her former director and how she left her little brother, giving some kind of conclusion to \"Hand\". The story is okay, even though it ended with bad ending, which eventually lead to more bad happenings in \"Another World\". Initially I sought this kind of story for the thrill, but it doesn't seem worthy. I better stick with Yuzuki's wholesome sister stories."},{"id":576256,"gallery_id":85109,"poster":{"id":1527258,"username":"7 Eyes","slug":"7-eyes","avatar_url":"avatars/1527258.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1532044162,"body":"There's another chp but while not a sad ending, it's not happy either"},{"id":430561,"gallery_id":85109,"poster":{"id":851026,"username":"TheKairos","slug":"thekairos","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1523962268,"body":"if anyone knows this story has to do with '' Hand '' and Can someone explain to me the end or better story?\nand whether it has continued or ended there?"}]
