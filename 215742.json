Cuntboys have to have a penis and a vagina.  l look at most of these and I'm like, oh, another flat-chested girl, oh, another muscular girl, oh, yet another friggin' girl!  Turn-off.  Also, If they look like girls, all done-up, long hair, girl face, skirt, huge boobs,, vagina, and a dick, they're a just another futanari.  pffft.  Futanari covers that entire range of girls-with-dicks, dicks with vaginas, dicks with balls and a clit-less vagina, and on and on.  This kink is no fun when you have to wade through tons of girl stuff to get to the few cuntboy stories.  I still like the n-hentai site bunches and bunches though.  XO."}]
