Also, on page 7, the picture where the girl is in front of the mirror, if you inspect the viewpoint perspective, isn't it a bit odd? So it seems like she's kinda standing up but the mirror shows she's laying on the floor? Look at the left where the door is... and not only that if we are looking up from her face, on the mirror image our viewpoint should be by the soda can, but then, if we are looking from this angle, we shouldn't be able to see her image at all, try it! This is some fucked up projectional space (I think the artist needs to learn some projective geometry)."}]
