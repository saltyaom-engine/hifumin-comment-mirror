The hours are divided as minutes and seconds into concentric units of 60 because your other hand can be used to count the sets of 12 you've made. This was the basis of counting in ancient Sumer, home of an accountant named Kushim, who is the earliest Human whose name has survived in written form through the ages. Kushim and his co-workers living in 3300 B.C. would have probably been annoyed about the extra 5.25 days in the year, which keep them from equaling 60 * 6, which is 360. (24 * 12) + (60 * 12) + (360 * 12) = 5328, which is about how many years Kushim lived before Epstein didn't kill himself."},{"id":2154603,"gallery_id":150258,"poster":{"id":4292432,"username":"L0lic0\u043fwizard","slug":"l0lic0pwizard","avatar_url":"avatars/4292432.png?_=ba9c2d59ac2636d2","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1637470306,"body":"Wow I'd completely forgotten about this its been years since I read the main story if this.
