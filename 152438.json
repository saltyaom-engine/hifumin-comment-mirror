guess I\u2019ll do the same and ask for a forgotten doujin I can\u2019t find. \nThe story is about a tsundere with some kind of high rank (like a princess or a noble, not sure). She keeps criminals in a dungeon, and whenever she walks past them they all get excited and horny. But eventually the glares and comments gets to her and she begins to like it and keep teasing them until she suddenly submit to the urges and let them fuck her, and it ends in a big and hot gangbang.\nThat\u2019s pretty much it, hopefully someone stumble upon this comment and know the sacred numbers and share it here.
