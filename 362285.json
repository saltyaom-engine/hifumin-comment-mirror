But as for Hitomi, I didn't see anything concrete where she will end up with Yena. A tease at the end, possibly, but that has been happening all throughout the series with nothing ever developing between them. Nothing was resolved about Hitomi's feelings for Jin or if either Hitomi and Yena were even willing to entertain the idea of them becoming closer. Even in the future time loop Hitomi and Yena weren't stated to be any closer than they already were so without any strong hints I don't see them getting together later. So for me, the end is open ended other than Jin and Lanka, hell even a harem for Jin could happen since nothing concrete was shown at the end for the rest of the other girls."},{"id":1802725,"gallery_id":362285,"poster":{"id":2871140,"username":"anjel88","slug":"anjel88","avatar_url":"avatars/2871140.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1623524298,"body":"Ok @Homosexual fire of the north.
