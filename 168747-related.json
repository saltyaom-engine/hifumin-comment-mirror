The bird adapted to these harsh environments by boosting its reproductive system in an immense phase through Parthenogenesis, this means that the bird itself can not only produce eggs at an unnatural speed, but it can also produce an immense number in such a short time meaning that if the parent were to be devoured by a predator, it would already have hundreds, perhaps even millions of eggs laid and that hatch in an instant after being laid.\u201d"},{"id":684657,"gallery_id":168747,"poster":{"id":1361634,"username":"Madustrate","slug":"madustrate","avatar_url":"avatars/1361634.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1536731375,"body":"Ive learned more things in here than my school."},{"id":671110,"gallery_id":168747,"poster":{"id":1309910,"username":"Laughing Coyote","slug":"laughing-coyote","avatar_url":"avatars/1309910.png?_=81cedf1ae1190900","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1535591961,"body":"This lady has mental health problems and I'm worried for her well-being."},{"id":352191,"gallery_id":168747,"poster":{"id":1299692,"username":"FabiTheLegend","slug":"fabithelegend","avatar_url":"avatars/1299692.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1516306305,"body":"I shouldn't be enjoying this..."},{"id":57086,"gallery_id":168747,"poster":{"id":334673,"username":"Kepone","slug":"kepone","avatar_url":"avatars/334673.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1471120436,"body":"best husbando/10"},{"id":52100,"gallery_id":168747,"poster":{"id":418164,"username":"GIVE_ME_SUM_BIG_DIDDY","slug":"give_me_sum_big_diddy","avatar_url":"avatars/418164.png?_=1beeca56142722ff","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1468177599,"body":"elf nuff said"}]
