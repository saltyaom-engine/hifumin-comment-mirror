That means, somehow, Bismarck is maybe have some war crime and get trial at Nuremberg Trial before he (yes, he) reincarnates to a shipgirl.\n\nBefore you say that some military men on Nazi Germany is not having war crime, such as Erwin Rommel, they have controversies around that. Those speculations is worked because they die before the trial of that exist, such as Erwin Rommel, or they didn't directly doing the war crime, such as secretly passing the order, or the document of that was burned or lost.
