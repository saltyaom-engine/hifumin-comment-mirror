Girl rejected a popular kid so the kid got a group of friends and kidnapped her and rape and beat her up, burned her skin a couple of times, made her eat glass (I think) and she eventually died from internal bleeding. Most of the boys were not arrested because they were never found by police but the ones who were arrested were put in jail. However, because Japan was a sexist country back then, the boys only got a few years in prison and were later released. Really fucked up\u2026"},{"id":1374829,"gallery_id":58817,"poster":{"id":3279234,"username":"brucucked","slug":"brucucked","avatar_url":"avatars/3279234.png?_=99f2385fca8c29f2","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1606799211,"body":"@Orusen Manigo Yeah thats Junko Furata my guy.

Pretty dark story if you ask me."}]
