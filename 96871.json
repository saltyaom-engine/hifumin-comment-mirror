No I don't think so, even if pregnant, I doubt her bust size will get any bigger to noticeable (have you seen how this artist draws pregnant flat chest's!) so naw. If Yandere smart she'll start getting him to forget the Female MC till he only sees any breast size past (I see if the two have a daughter and she gets \"lucky\" in the bust department in puberty his \"PTSD\" kicking in and him treating her like shit till she \"reduces their sizes\" like a nutjob! Seeing that Yandere is filthy rich! It shouldn't be hard to do....or force) I will say love the degeneration for the Female MC, she might have recovered if Male MC wasn't a huge naive idiot (which she was right to call him at the end) and thought with his head over his emotions....but nope, he thought 100% with his emotions and it burned im hard (thinking after a year of NC after that, she would want him back....SERIOUSLY?)"},{"id":2211204,"gallery_id":96871,"poster":{"id":1595243,"username":"LordCellofEarth9","slug":"lordcellofearth9","avatar_url":"avatars/1595243.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640099524,"body":"I'll say this \"Evil always wins.... because Good is dumb!\" Seriously the only reason everything bad happened to the Male MC and Female MC was because they didn't care to think of the consequences of their actions (Female MC never concluding for a smart girl that all those \"recordings\" would come back to bite her in the ass! And Male MC for being a dumbass, such as why Flatty even had that DVD and showed him, or why he assumed after what he did and what I guessed a year of NC with Female MC that she would still be the innocent girl he remembered and would take him back! I'm sure she was made aware he was coming and wanted to hurt him as much as he hurt her! I'd assume the \"ring money\" amount was larger then that and she lied just to hurt him more). Good story none the less, largely cause it showed NTR logic at it's worse and that's not a bad thing since the point seems to be that Evil only one cause \"good was literally stupid\" as NTR logic only works because of that!
