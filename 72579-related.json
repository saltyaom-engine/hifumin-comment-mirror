But it escalates, and they, and just about everyone else surrounding them, wants more, more, until nothing remains in their hollow lives but sex and sleaze. It becomes impossible to feel any empathy for them and the grief they are constantly plunging themselves into. They're beyond saving. They deserve everything that happens to them. And so, I cannot bring myself to care when it tries to play the girl as the victim/the tragic heroine. The real victim here is the bf for being deceived by such deplorable people. Love is blind, as the cheesy proverb goes, but in this case, they must also be blind in the literal sense."}]
