This story dives deep into why the characters do what they do. The tags and fetishes are not there for just the sake of kink but to help drive the story. Just read it and see how it turns out, I am sure most will enjoy the story. I am bothered by the decisions made by the characters, but we are at least given backgrounds that explain said decisions."},{"id":1520126,"gallery_id":27792,"poster":{"id":3322860,"username":"shinjixx","slug":"shinjixx","avatar_url":"avatars/3322860.png?_=d38e3aa62f9843bc","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611344082,"body":"Great work, live adaptation is URE-002"}]
