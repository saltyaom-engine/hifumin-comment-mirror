I HAVE BEEN WAITING TEN THOUSAND LONG YEARS...!!!! Ichinose is my favorite and I was genuinely worried that Katsura Airi dropped this. Holy fuck I cannot wait for the translation! 1) The sex scenes with jealous junior were actually really hot. 2) I'm relieved that the new skeevy stubble man has not yet been featured naked.

Then theoretically, she'll emotionally break and accept Ichinose. This makes me feel better about the hotwifing thing, if this was his machination. The real question is if Ichinose holds genuine affection for her, or if he'll depart from the wreckage of his conquest..."},{"id":2268342,"gallery_id":387873,"poster":{"id":4688594,"username":"ALUCARD ARI","slug":"alucard-ari","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642338190,"body":"I have a NTR story that happened in my city to sum up the cheater and her partner get burned up in the a car they caught theme in"},{"id":2265589,"gallery_id":387873,"poster":{"id":2828432,"username":"Nec_Mergitur","slug":"nec_mergitur","avatar_url":"avatars/2828432.png?_=c7115b4a62eb406c","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642220152,"body":"@jettigger77 I think it's spelled \"Halal\""},{"id":2264640,"gallery_id":387873,"poster":{"id":4550384,"username":"jettigger77","slug":"jettigger77","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642178651,"body":"Lmao this idiot is the fall guy.
