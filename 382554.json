He and the heroine are childhood friends and have a crush on each other, but they didn't confess their love (what worse, heroine doesn't know the gal is MC). MC wants to give up and get brainwashed (government service), totally forget he was ever a man, but the health doctor encourages MC to confess the truth and his love to the girl, before it was too late. To his surprise, the heroine accepts him and is revealed to be bisexual. MC turns back to man and have a sex with heroine for the ever last time. In the end, they become a lesbian couple."},{"id":2181147,"gallery_id":382554,"poster":{"id":390873,"username":"Dragonking69","slug":"dragonking69","avatar_url":"avatars/390873.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1638678931,"body":"Girl finds out she's les but her friend isn't.
