As a recap, 2021 had a terrible start but towards the middle we started having hope. Vaccines were getting made for coming and things were slightly going back to normal. Then, because things were going back to normal, everybody thought it would be a good time to start socialising in large groups again and we almost had a second lock down. Fortunately, at the time of writing this, 28 Sep 2021, things have started going back to complete normality. Vaccines are widespread and they are now even giving them to children 15 or younger. Hopefully 2022 will be nice."},{"id":1971031,"gallery_id":2022,"poster":{"id":1013949,"username":"Api","slug":"api","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629850257,"body":"Is Covid still around"},{"id":1841636,"gallery_id":2022,"poster":{"id":4242079,"username":"Chicken Battousai","slug":"chicken-battousai","avatar_url":"avatars/4242079.png?_=411eaa9021706cf8","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1625035848,"body":"The doujin for the next year is kinda fine"},{"id":1036120,"gallery_id":2022,"poster":{"id":3396976,"username":"Shizaaa","slug":"shizaaa","avatar_url":"avatars/3396976.png?_=a287fefbd8f9586a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593171024,"body":"DAMN IT, 2022 year joke isn't mine either."}]
