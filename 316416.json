Just some corrections; Sakura is enjoying the fact that Rin was crying on the first day of the torture/rape (who wouldn't be? especially since Rin's a virgin, she cried her first time with Shirou even and that was consenual), not that she's been \"broken\" by it yet. And Sakura was very much broken by it after a year or two as evident from Zero (again, who wouldn't be? constant rape by worms is far from pleasant), it took meeting Shirou for her to no longer consider committing suicide daily. Rin would probably take just as long to actually break as Sakura did due to Rin being one of the strongest-willed characters in FSN."},{"id":1020710,"gallery_id":316416,"poster":{"id":2313028,"username":"maxdrell911","slug":"maxdrell911","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1592618970,"body":"While I can't read the moonrunes, the most likely plot, is that this follows on from the final part of Heavens Feel. In the original after Rider (with Shirou's help) manages to injure her enough that she collapses, you have to choose to kill Saber Alter when Shirou has the opportunity. Hesitating causes her insult Shirou's cowardice before she vanishes into the Grail mud as she is re-summoned by Dark Sakura (who was in another chamber fighting Rin and losing). As a result, Rin is instantly overpowered by the healed Saber Alter. By the time he catches up, Rin is nowhere to be seen, and Dark Sakura claims she is being put through the same kind of torment she suffered (with Sakura laughing that it barely took a few minutes to \"break\" her in comparison to the 10 years Sakura survived). Scene ends with Shirou losing all hope as Sark Sakura absorbed Shirou into her shadows sadistically saying he is hers now.\n\nThis is meant to follow on from there I'm assuming."},{"id":1012429,"gallery_id":316416,"poster":{"id":3367637,"username":"ryokuucha","slug":"ryokuucha","avatar_url":"avatars/3367637.png?_=0edac76d4909afda","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1592336113,"body":"this is probably my new favourite doujinshi. so excited for the translated ver"},{"id":1004962,"gallery_id":316416,"poster":{"id":2830227,"username":"Noubackfire","slug":"noubackfire","avatar_url":"avatars/2830227.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1592118535,"body":"I have mixed feelings, on one hand this gets me hard, the other it makes me depressed.
