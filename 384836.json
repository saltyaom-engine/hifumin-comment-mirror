First of all, no fandom has innocent reputation. They came as the fandom grew bigger and bigger, creating toxic people and troublesome 18+ artists. Second, if the anime has a warning about spoiling and restricted rules, the fandom will be silent just like Kalego wishes for. Third, I'm gonna say it around again, once the fandom of the anime grew larger, you can't do anything about it. The same goes with Obey Me otome game. Someone already made rule 34 of the seven demon brothers, and I of course disappointed and feel shocked. I leave the fandom and never thought I feel better after deleting the game and leaving the fandom at the same time. As a person who went a lot of toxic fandoms, you can't do anything about it. If you at least want to stop it, become an idiot to yourself. It is quite immature when such toxic fandom exist cause that's"},{"id":2220187,"gallery_id":384836,"poster":{"id":4584550,"username":"Arroz124","slug":"arroz124","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640435665,"body":"Melhoro meu natal kkkkk"},{"id":2219870,"gallery_id":384836,"poster":{"id":1939921,"username":"Itzki soyoki","slug":"itzki-soyoki","avatar_url":"avatars/1939921.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640423635,"body":"STOP RUINING THIS FANDOM!!!!!"}]
