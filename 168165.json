The ending especially is what took the most out of me: A man having his entire world collapse in an instant, and both the reader, and the main character can't do anything but listen to the hollow voices of the people around him. For his wife, it really wasn't her fault, she didn't deserve the treatment she was given, and had her trust betrayed. As for Yura, she was the driving point for everything in the story, though its because of her all these terrible things happen, but I can't deny her being there to help Kim get through his sadness may have helped a small bit to get him back together with Seonghee. Overall I really enjoyed the hentai."},{"id":1544384,"gallery_id":168165,"poster":{"id":3843847,"username":"Gunna\ud83c\udd7f\ufe0f","slug":"gunna","avatar_url":"avatars/3843847.png?_=0da495ccd261e3a7","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1612415255,"body":"I really just spent over 2 hours reading this, and I don't regret it one bit.
