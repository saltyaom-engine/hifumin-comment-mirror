I BET HE WAS HIDING IN THE RIVER BECAUSE HE STOLE SOMETHING! I BET HE STOLE SOME CRACK COCANE! NIGGERS LOVE CRACK! I BET HE STOLE IT AFTER EATING FRIED CHICKEN AND WATERMELON! I BET THE WATERMELON WAS GROWN IN A 500 SQUARE FOOT GREENHOUSE BY A FILIPINO MAN NAMED LEE! AND THAT THE GREENHOUSE WAS KEPT AROUND 30 DIGRESS AND HE FERTILIZED THE WATERMELON VINES WITH 5-5-5 NKP FERTILIZER THAT THEY BUY IN BULK FROM CHINA BECAUSE CHINA SELLS CHEAPER FERTILIZER THAN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES AND REALLY AS LONG AS THE NPK AND MICRONUTRIENTS ARE RIGHT THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHEAP CHINESE FERTILIZERS AND MORE EXPENSIVE FERTILIZERS MADE IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE EUROPE OR THE US! I BET THE WATERMELONS CONTAINED TRACE AMOUNTS OF FUNGICIDES, PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES INCLUDING BUT \nNOT LIMITED TO BUSTER, SMITE, PIRON 70 AND DIMETHYLTRYPTAMINE!
