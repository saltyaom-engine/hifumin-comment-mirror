Found just an author forward in the tankouban discussing the chapter. https://nhentai.net/g/22859/237/ It\u2019s the one that\u2019s on the date 2008/06. You can go ahead and machine translate it if you want, big block of text. But basically it\u2019s his thought process for the story and how he views the ending, saying it rained on their relationship and it could be a good or bad ending with them splitting up or not based on whether the adversity solidifies their foundations. It\u2019s the phrase ame futte ji katamaru, ground becomes solid after heavy rain. It means the relationship gets stronger after facing adversity. So if the rain solidifies their relationship, then they\u2019ll have a good ending. The title is literally ame futte after all. I liked the author\u2019s note cause it suggests we can take the ending in what direction we\u2019d like."},{"id":1629310,"gallery_id":12505,"poster":{"id":3419092,"username":"zikakuto","slug":"zikakuto","avatar_url":"avatars/3419092.png?_=447dcb06b77e5440","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1616231160,"body":"I wish there was more to the story.
