The canon story of the game is (spoiler allert) set 3 years after the MC entered in the school. Long story short, the memories of the entire class got erased and they no longer remember what happened in those 2-3 years. This doujin is an interpretation of what kind of relationship Kirigiri and Naegi used to have before their memory got erased. Basically in this doujin they already visited that \"garden\" multiple times togheter, and even id they can't remember those moments, they got some kind of flashes and feelings.
