Japan never truly underwent an equivalent of denazification, and many war criminals and others closely tied to Imperial Japanese warmongering quietly reentered Japanese politics after the end of the American occupation, often with CIA support.

MacArthur didn't agree with dropping the bomb, and in fact was never even consulted. Ralph Bard, Undersecretary of the Navy, disagreed with the bombs. Leahy, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, disagreed with their use. There wasp lenty of dissent. We were well aware the Japanese were already making attempts at a negotiated surrender via Moscow mediation, and there were plenty of voices in the Truman administration who advised letting the Japanese know they could keep their Emperor, their number one concern (in the end they were allowed to keep him even after unconditionally surrendering). The claim we had to nuke them rests on the false assumption that there was no alternative to invasion. Plenty of people just wanted to keep blockading the home islands. The post-war Strategic Bombing Survey assessed that the nukes weren't needed and continued sea-mining of shipping lanes would have done the job by November 1945."},{"id":659480,"gallery_id":242881,"poster":{"id":1786832,"username":"KiyohimeLancer","slug":"kiyohimelancer","avatar_url":"avatars/1786832.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1534470487,"body":"And so, we fap.\n\nThe End"},{"id":659350,"gallery_id":242881,"poster":{"id":1873425,"username":"Im_a_fucking_sinner","slug":"im_a_fucking_sinner","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1534459493,"body":"WE'D SEEN AND SUFFERED THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE CRUELTY INFLICTED BY THE AVERAGE JAPANESE SOLDIER, WHO WAS A BULLY, A RAPIST AND A MISERABLE LITTLE FUCK WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE.

He was talking about the late war mining and blockading of inter-island shipping. He was not talking about starving Japan in 1941, before they started the war with the Western powers. \n\nThat and the ridiculous portrayal of an ABCD encirclement of Japan reek of revisionism. This is basically Japan going and beating up its neighbors, and then whining that its surrounded by enemies. FDR didn't enact oil embargoes against Japan because he was friends with rich people in China (I'm not sure if the doujin author actually belives this or is just recounting what some Japanese at the time thought), he did it because he was appalled by what the Japanese were doing.\n\nThis seems to be a giant blind spot with many Japanese. They have no comprehension of what was done to China, and just kind of a dumb Homer Simpson slow blink response to outrage about it."}]
