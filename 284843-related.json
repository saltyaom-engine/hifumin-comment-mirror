This is why NTR artists should make their own world and not try to insert themselves into established shit! Out of the many hentai genres! They are the worst at causing lore breaks just to justify their \"Villain Sue NTR antagonist\" \nLike to think this wasn't the girl having a losing dream before she was enslaved but instead the asshole fatass having a dying one where he didn't even get hte first girl and was just \"imagining\" as he was killed that he won! I do it with alot of these's NTR as they feel too off to make sense without thinking it's the asshole knocked out or dying and having a \"Sweet dream\" (Took it from the Amagi Park hentai where the asshole was put in a dream to see if he was worthy to be a manager and turns out he didn't and perverted it so \"Sweet dreams\" before being made to forget EVERYTHING! Being a fool who will have a desire he'll NEVER get, but feel like he did!)"}]
