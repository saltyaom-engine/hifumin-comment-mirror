The only real issue is when someone steals a series of bills from a bank - hence why robbers ask for \"unmarked\" bills, they don't want a linear series of bill numbers to trace. That said I could see having a job even just to have an alibi or something to do. Especially if you end up working somewhere that lets you meet cute girls."},{"id":139088,"gallery_id":200321,"poster":{"id":813411,"username":"Laffeydrink_","slug":"laffeydrink_","avatar_url":"avatars/813411.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1499730199,"body":"Nice         "},{"id":138439,"gallery_id":200321,"poster":{"id":148065,"username":"PramTheOracle","slug":"pramtheoracle","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1499604375,"body":"Money that can easily be traced?\n\nCome on man."},{"id":138415,"gallery_id":200321,"poster":{"id":204606,"username":"Junko Affairs","slug":"junko-affairs","avatar_url":"avatars/204606.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1499596495,"body":"Wtf man.
