I don\u2019t know why I did that, but it was because some guy who loved teasing me a lot \u201ccoerced\u201d me and the girl to do it. I also remember getting scolded by the teacher \ud83d\ude02 (idk if my parents scolded me too but they probably did, my memory isn\u2019t as bright as it used to)"}]
