She didn't really gain anything; she only lost. She clearly developed feelings for him and wouldn't mind remaining by his side, and it's not like she even used the freedom that she earned in the end. She just lived a quiet and most likely lonely life for god knows how many years until she eventually died as well. Reizoku Maou had a happy ending, so I was expecting this one to pull the resurrection card too. I'm glad it didn't. Sure, it's heartbreaking, but that's the point; invoking some kind of feeling on the reader. While it is nice to see happy endings, I respect artists that don't shy away from making sad ones. It feels fresh and genuine."},{"id":1512326,"gallery_id":284778,"poster":{"id":849157,"username":"Pusangcat","slug":"pusangcat","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611026503,"body":"sad part of an long lived elf"},{"id":1204322,"gallery_id":284778,"poster":{"id":3580603,"username":"Habib Rizqie Shahaq","slug":"habib-rizqie-shahaq","avatar_url":"avatars/3580603.png?_=66034ca20d550bfb","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1599811259,"body":"she's free, but at what cost"},{"id":1151551,"gallery_id":284778,"poster":{"id":3551662,"username":"macnbac","slug":"macnbac","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1597637567,"body":"WELL NOW I'M SAD"},{"id":1109978,"gallery_id":284778,"poster":{"id":2871983,"username":"sakatagintoki35","slug":"sakatagintoki35","avatar_url":"avatars/2871983.png?_=1adb8cb9ec9f7fe0","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1596001322,"body":"Bittersweet but wholesome ending!
