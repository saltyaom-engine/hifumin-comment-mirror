Honestly though, I felt like MC was pretty callous and uncaring, or just didn't know what the fuck why he even went in a relationship with A-chan, so Im glad C-kun and A-chan get together. She still had lingering feelings for MC, but her new relationship is definitely more healthy than having an \"unrequited\" love with MC."},{"id":865561,"gallery_id":267920,"poster":{"id":1566853,"username":"gumala","slug":"gumala","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1554412885,"body":"@Fallen_Leaf I mean they're no longer dating, hence the title moto kano, and the story can be summarize as A-chan love B-kun and they started dating, but B-kun isn't that interested in A-chan so they broke up, C-kun who truly love A-chan confess to her and A-chan accept it and they live happily ever after... if that is not vanilla i don't know what is.."},{"id":865354,"gallery_id":267920,"poster":{"id":1883884,"username":"Fallen_Leaf","slug":"fallen_leaf","avatar_url":"avatars/1883884.png?_=ad2fa79cc76b7742","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1554396407,"body":"@gumala Did you read ?
