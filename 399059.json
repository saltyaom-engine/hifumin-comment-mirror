But sadly sometimes the art just doesn't do  it for me same with other artist no matter how good or bad it is you just get used to it or it just has some boundaries like if they keep using the same type of facial features of the other characters it just gets boring but anyways my point here is I'm not really too bother to join that discord group of yours xD\n"},{"id":2460855,"gallery_id":399059,"poster":{"id":4662561,"username":"rexmil110","slug":"rexmil110","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1650053141,"body":"Hello, I don't know if Anyone is seeing this but I'll make a Discord server to share our liking of jeanne dack and any other artist that you like, currently there will be English and spanish Chat  Discord: https://discord.gg/PG5Wyz3A"}]
