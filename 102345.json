Obviously such a scale and notion is completely relative.  Theres no such thing as hot, fundamentally- theres only \"hotter than X\" where X is usually left out of the sentence (outside, what temperature it normally is on afternoons in the region, on the surface of the sun, etc.)  People tend to think language/words have \"definitive\" meaning, but most things are pretty muddy when it gets down to it. So things like \"mean person\" or \"schitzo\" or \"socialist\", etc. all come in shades.

Its the great equalizer. Although in a few generations humans will achieve \"negligible senescence\" - meaning they will unlock the regulatory mechanisms behind apoptosis and aging, probably inserting a secondary checksum system to counteract cancer/etc.  Then the top 1-5% richest people on the planet *will* live for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of years, employing entire nation-states to protect them from the poor- who they will probably turn into slaves. At least, if we don't nuke ourselves extinct before then.
