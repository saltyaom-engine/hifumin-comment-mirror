Her tits are smaller and her ass a lot bigger in this one, so she's closer to the sexualized loli ideal (such as Fate's Jack the Ripper), meaning my previous guess was off. Anyone who likes this less either prefers more \"pure\" lolis or mostly liked older girls in the first place and just enjoyed this series for whatever reason because of Menyoujan's unique art style.\nI maintain that this doujin took far more skill to draw than all previous ones though. A growing Menyoujan or an assistant, this was done by a more talented artist than the one who drew the last four parts. Consider that maybe it just no longer plays to your fetish first before you accuse it of dropping in quality.
