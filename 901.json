Overall, I still am on these bad ones. \n1/10.\nAlso, 7estificate, I usually just look at the art, you can understand a little of what is going on by doing that. For example, on the first one, by looking at the first page, I can understand that her gaining a dick happened not too long ago, since she is crying while showing it. Then, from how her face is drawn, I see that her friend reluctantly wants to help but making it small, in hopes of it going to normal. Using these two, I get that the story is about the two fucking after a dick grew on the first girl and, therefore there is no reason to why such things happened which shows that the author just wanted to do something and not a enough detailed story. I hope that this answers your question and see you next time.\nAlso, Also, thanks, knowing that someone is making this journey with me greatly helps.\n"},{"id":2439557,"gallery_id":901,"poster":{"id":4384451,"username":"7estificate","slug":"7estificate","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1649157172,"body":"@MinaYaku Do you understand these Japanese ones, or do you just look at the art?
