(It's '\u59b9\u3068\u3044\u3063\u3057\u3087\u3002- My Sweet Sister - ' - MAPLER/milkberry)\n\nThis is the strangest 'lost doujin' experience I have had until now. I read both this one and \nthe prequel years ago (around the time they came out) and enjoyed it quite a bit. Then I forgot\nabout it after which I tried finding it again for years. Somehow it appears as if it was completely\npurged from the internet, only to be reappear in its current incomplete form."}]
