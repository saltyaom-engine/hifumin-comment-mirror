Christ you should know that Shin(MC of Kenja) is so OP he could kill a dragon and Sicily the Heroine of this Hentai is also so powerful in strength random blokes won't harm her. So with this you should just throw away any semblance of logic and just think of her as a weak and powerless girl. Even if she was a saint. No Comment about Hoshiguma though.
