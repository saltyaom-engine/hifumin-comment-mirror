I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were raped I wouldn't lose by the pleasure"},{"id":2464088,"gallery_id":399659,"poster":{"id":4771753,"username":"yorusuyasoul","slug":"yorusuyasoul","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1650183176,"body":"bruh momento"}]
