For those who don\u2019t know, this is a clever homage to the popular manga/anime series Jojo no Kimy\u014du na Bouken (or more popularly known as Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure worldwide) in which the antagonist Dio Brando (later changed to simply \u201cDIO\u201d) is often referenced by those around the character Remilia Scarlet such as Remilia herself, the 6th stage boss of the critically acclaimed Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, and Sakuya Izayoi, the 5th stage boss of the same game. During the years many fans have noted some similarities from Sakuya such as her tendency to throw knives, a weapon that DIO ironically used as a ranged weapon in Part 3: Stardust Crusaders due to guns being useless in stopped time, and Sakuya\u2019s ability to stop time being named \u201cThe World\u201d."},{"id":2083155,"gallery_id":376522,"poster":{"id":4292432,"username":"L0lic0\u043fwizard","slug":"l0lic0pwizard","avatar_url":"avatars/4292432.png?_=ba9c2d59ac2636d2","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634300606,"body":"Part 2: but vin is on the other side, somehow already there before you, posting a picture of an elephant with an inspirational quote on social media.
