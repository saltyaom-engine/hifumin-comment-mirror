But given what Gin said in the first chapter, basically confess without regret, it is somewhat safe to assume that he has moved on in some capacity as Setsuna rejected him to go on with Sensei and he probably assumed that Setsuna is doing her own thing and he'll support. Whereas Tomo figured out something was off since they both liked/loved each other, so she searched for him, but he didn't. He could still have something, but yeah, Zutto is open-ended (which I don't like personally lol). But basically, Setsuna regretted her actions at the end by remembering Gin's promises and it might've went differently."},{"id":1556464,"gallery_id":347100,"poster":{"id":2061364,"username":"hentaienthusiast424","slug":"hentaienthusiast424","avatar_url":"avatars/2061364.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1612938468,"body":"god fucking damnit there are just too many doujins and manwha that have ugly bastard and ntr I really wish ugly bastard and ntr never existed and those that like or love ugly bastard and ntr never existed either"},{"id":1556400,"gallery_id":347100,"poster":{"id":3055318,"username":"Icedtea","slug":"icedtea","avatar_url":"avatars/3055318.png?_=8b5bd005bb290eb5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1612935652,"body":"SS Tier.
