Potentially two generations of incest going on here what with Saya potentially being his daughter and then her also having his daughter as well. I guess what they don't know for sure wont hurt them? I'd have been too afraid not to check the DNA test if I was actually concerned it was a legitimate possibility and not willing to say fuck the rules. All not looking at the test does is ensure they always have it somewhere in the back of their mind.\r\n\r\nSurprised the two sisters/aunt-niece pair ended up in such a relationship at the end though... Guess they're going for as much incest as they manage in this story. Kinda wish we could see what Saya and Mine's relationship was like beforehand though. There's lots of talk during that scene which implies they've been around each other's nether regions a fair number of times in the past."}]
