It's not like they're officially BF/GF. Sure, it's scummy to use him for money, but girls do that all the time. She's not cheating on him or anything, just leading him on. Very different than say with her teacher and ruining his engagement and the son of the pastor and actually cheating on him and ruining his life... After this new chapter (#28) I am willing to bet she f*cks things up for this new girl or something like that. That is my conclusions to justify her punishment by this guy. It would be a really spiteful thing to do since I doubt losing this guy would mean much in her sea of sugar daddies. Deserving her punishment."}]
