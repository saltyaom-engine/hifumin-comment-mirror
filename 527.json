No. Was it the best thing here? Yes. But I feel like it can only be a warning to our society. The plate is there to symbolize the dangers that we don't see coming because we are to focused on doing what others want us to do. It slowly approaching let's us understand that such dangers are slow, like not understanding that just trying once to gamble will led our life to another path, one in which we don't wanna go. And, the simplicity in which the character is drawn, also let's us understand that it can happen to anyone, that if you are not careful and lose yourself living the life that the others want you to live, you will end hurt. And the white background was the chef's kiss, the sadness, disorientation and emptiness that it transmits is really top notch, like the guy just wanted to be happy but even that simple emotion was lost while looking to make everyone else happy. Other than that is a meh. 3/10."}]
