These doujins would be god tier if you just take out the NTR ! I\u2019m not even asking to remove the rape/mind control/mind break stuff, in fact I love it. But NTR is just an unnecessary addition to the pile of \u201cdark\u201d tags and just makes the whole doujin extremely hard to enjoy. So many top tier art doujins like this are ruined by NTR and it\u2019s a damn shame.
