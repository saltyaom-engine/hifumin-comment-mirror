Sadly the former have yet to be scanned (though if you're cool with digital copies locked up behind DMM's reader you can get access to most of  Eda's other works any time). As for guest appearances Eda make an appearance on page 46 in \"[CRAFT (Kiliu)] Fuyu ni mo Nandemo Chousa Shoujo no Doujinshi ga Deta Wakarimashita Chousa Shimasu\". As for Eda's personal works  I don't know the romanji version but if you want see them here are 3 I know of, \u8912\u3081\u3089\u308c\u6deb\u8a9e\u3068\u53f1\u3089\u308c\u6deb\u8a9e ,  \u304b\u306e\u3058\u3087\u306e\u4e00\u77ac  ,  \u5148\u751f\u306e\u3001\u71b1\u304f\u3066\u3001\u4e00\u756a\u5965  . On top of that Eda has a nijie.info account if you've got one or know some1 who does who can hook you up I'd highly suggest checking out the stuff Eda (\u6c5f\u7530) posts there its delicious. Hope this helps"},{"id":324472,"gallery_id":214466,"poster":{"id":629003,"username":"hitoshisan","slug":"hitoshisan","avatar_url":"avatars/629003.png?_=6f2ae4abc9abecec","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1511036728,"body":"I need more from this artist..."}]
