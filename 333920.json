Then Ishida say's Inoue tempted him over and over but that even if Ichigo's soul comes back he won't let her go? Does that mean he killed Ichigo then stole/raped Inoue till she became his and took in Ichigo's kid, since Kasui is the son between Ichigo and Inoue? This plot seems pretty dark if you think about it and read what Ishida is saying."}]
