Aside from being in the same position because of their father's aristocratic background, they don't have the same predictable and simple chemistry as Lelouch and CC or Shirley. Lelouch and Kallen's relationship really reminds me of Eren and Mikasa's relationship, especially the similarities between CG ss2 ep 19 and AOT chapter 112."},{"id":1843590,"gallery_id":361885,"poster":{"id":1781700,"username":"LongNoseTribe","slug":"longnosetribe","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1625122755,"body":"I'm pissed this isn't canon.\nBut hey atleast C.C is still alive."},{"id":1790678,"gallery_id":361885,"poster":{"id":1398487,"username":"WholesomeIsntAnAdjective","slug":"wholesomeisntanadjective","avatar_url":"avatars/1398487.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1623082472,"body":"the cover art was better than the story"},{"id":1788457,"gallery_id":361885,"poster":{"id":48419,"username":"DragaliaLostUwU","slug":"dragalialostuwu","avatar_url":"avatars/48419.png?_=46123ac542de37a0","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1623017252,"body":"This has to be a parallel universe"}]
