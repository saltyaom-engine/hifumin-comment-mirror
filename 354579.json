Very typical. There are many reasons for this, but mostly, it's pandering, ol' marketing tactic of appealing to certain aspects that are either liked... or rather obsessively coveted by the target demographic on the females, while the males, in order to make them relatable with said target demographic, are regular looking, the quintessential typical japanese main character looks like and acts/behaves in a most generic pattern. Never noticed it? Of course, the same goes specially for hentai. They will say that it's because of some color association with some bullshit or because the lighting/shading and their mothers, whatever, they're lying. It sells more, that's why, it's mone\u00a5 and it's thirst for the \"exotic\", ever since desnay dropped \"Alice in Wonderland\" over there, the japs have been obsessed with yellow haired females or males.

Thats's a conve ient excuse. The reality is that apparently most asians males tend to be slightly darker shade skinned then the females, or rather, the female beauty factor across asia is for females to be as fair light skinned as possible, because that equals to wealth and \"purity\", hence how the \"geishas\" (premium prostitutes) would paint themselves white. the whole gyaru thing is the poor/peasant class rebelling against that \"pure\" standard factor by going in the opposite direction, darker skin and light hair. Anyways, in most asian media (commercials, ads, movies, games, anime/manga, idol pop groups, etc), you'll always see a light skinned female being the center cast (exceptions are possible, but rare, count how many darkish female leads compared to the amounts of token yellow/red/white haired, blue/green eyed pale/light female leads or MC's interest are usually present) -"},{"id":1670483,"gallery_id":354579,"poster":{"id":287537,"username":"YumeYume","slug":"yumeyume","avatar_url":"avatars/287537.png?_=c4ee1b246cff6a56","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618023749,"body":"Sometimes it's also because it could accentuate the girl more, because the focus is on her so the contrast between dark and light is needed.
