We're still down there. Painting with our... with our... fingers and... our toes... we paint pictures of horses and sheep of birds and trees of trucks and houses, someone painted a picture of a... a thing that looked like a... a ball of meat and hair, bloody and wet... we didn't complain... just watched... and waited... m a s t u r b a t i n g with the paint... slip slop slap, slip slop slap, slip slop... slap.
