The girl (Haruka), as you said, her father's company is bankrupt and being offered money from the Glass-guy in exchange for her body. She has a boyfriend as she wanted to keep her virginity for him (I think it's the guy u said as on her social media post showing the guy in the photo background) after 3-month dating, that's what I gathered from when she cried. But it's only considered NTR if it shows the BF POV reacting to the situation + degrading/ humilating either BF or the Girl. If not, it's just cheating in general."},{"id":1394999,"gallery_id":339066,"poster":{"id":2348882,"username":"incel","slug":"incel","avatar_url":"avatars/2348882.png?_=b3843a6bae065a22","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1607542998,"body":"so what's the story here? is it ntr or does she have a crush on that blonde guy, her father's in money trouble and glasses-kun helps out in exchange for the V? do they get together in the end?"},{"id":1394973,"gallery_id":339066,"poster":{"id":330808,"username":"Moskol","slug":"moskol","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1607542203,"body":"\u30fd(~_~(\u30fb_\u30fb )\u309dWait wut??
