Even the artist said post script there were just too many girls to focus on and little time so she was a one off. Her whole character didn't even matter lmao. Plus she became obsessed with the outside world anyway &amp; she fucked a dude to get what she wanted. So she got a happy ending regardless "},{"id":95895,"gallery_id":132493,"poster":{"id":993518,"username":"ecboy00","slug":"ecboy00","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1488428001,"body":"Why couldn't Ixia just stick to banging the MC.
