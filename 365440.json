The fact that you (and others) think that defloration is the only way to make a girl feel pain during penetration only reinforces that assumption. And once again, her face in p15 isn't even pain. That expression is SO common in hentai, especially in this genre with small girls and big dicks. This artist isn't even known for drawing virgin girls. Seriously, why are you guys trying to make this girl a virgin?"},{"id":1865780,"gallery_id":365440,"poster":{"id":2941020,"username":"agapehhhhhhh","slug":"agapehhhhhhh","avatar_url":"avatars/2941020.png?_=f0322ec092d34038","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1626045235,"body":"@aldyn that only reason i can think i know not only virgin woman can get nervous about what she give to her boyfriend every girl that so much love her boyfriend do the same but if you give more attention on page 15 u can see her face that 'maybe' she get hurts cause that face is when u shocked about something.

There are many ways, in fact, like shoving the whole thing inside her at once (exactly how the guy did it here), and even then I wouldn't consider p15 as her feeling pain. More like surprise, which is exactly what she expressed through words. And even if we pretend like she felt pain, that's not how tags work around here. Exhentai requires solid evidence that it's the girl's first time, either visually (blood) or verbally.
