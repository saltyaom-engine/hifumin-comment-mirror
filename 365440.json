The fact that you (and others) think that defloration is the only way to make a girl feel pain during penetration only reinforces that assumption. And once again, her face in p15 isn't even pain. That expression is SO common in hentai, especially in this genre with small girls and big dicks. This artist isn't even known for drawing virgin girls.

There are many ways, in fact, like shoving the whole thing inside her at once (exactly how the guy did it here), and even then I wouldn't consider p15 as her feeling pain. More like surprise, which is exactly what she expressed through words. And even if we pretend like she felt pain, that's not how tags work around here. Exhentai requires solid evidence that it's the girl's first time, either visually (blood) or verbally. A facial expression isn't nearly enough for the tag."},{"id":1862447,"gallery_id":365440,"poster":{"id":3377844,"username":"MatsVlak","slug":"matsvlak","avatar_url":"avatars/3377844.png?_=980f4a3e2aa5e20d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1625905849,"body":"This aint netorare wth\n"},{"id":1862300,"gallery_id":365440,"poster":{"id":577671,"username":"krista","slug":"krista","avatar_url":"avatars/577671.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1625900854,"body":"Good friend, really."},{"id":1862034,"gallery_id":365440,"poster":{"id":159209,"username":"Chetti","slug":"chetti","avatar_url":"avatars/159209.png?_=1bdfa34564dcf25d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1625891375,"body":"The fuck is the NTR tag for? she wasn't in any relationship she just liked a guy... geez..."},{"id":1861990,"gallery_id":365440,"poster":{"id":847082,"username":"Evidenox","slug":"evidenox","avatar_url":"avatars/847082.png?_=60d51aab2cb60003","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1625889599,"body":"@Aldyn she's clearly enduring pain on pg 15 @alonerone Netoru has the Kanji for sleep and take so the connotation of the word is to take while the person is sleeping or to take while the other is unaware.
