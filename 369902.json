Talking of cucked, Hiro (the 1st guy) probably starts too early with Kotori and she's ready to give him what he wants, so he took it as granted. Their sex always means she's satisfying him. Meanwhile Sarugaki, the part time job's manager told her, relationship should be about giving to each other, something that fill what she always wanted in her heart. When another girl, new club manager, is close to Hiro, Kotori found out she doesn't feel anything, not jealousy. After her part time job is over, Hiro asks her out, and Kotori did the right thing to end her affair (the manager also offered her that choice to end their relationship). But after saying good bye, she realized her heart had moved on to another man. At least Hiro seems to be doing better with his second girlfriend."},{"id":1961649,"gallery_id":369902,"poster":{"id":4009268,"username":"W33DisG0D420","slug":"w33disg0d420","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629533818,"body":"This is the best hentai artist hands down"},{"id":1960104,"gallery_id":369902,"poster":{"id":455040,"username":"kcjpunk","slug":"kcjpunk","avatar_url":"avatars/455040.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629479818,"body":"so for the record this is something new guy who get cucked actually gets to married another girl and gyaru-oh actually care for the main girl. its win-win situation.   \n\n "},{"id":1959965,"gallery_id":369902,"poster":{"id":4119551,"username":"Fawacka","slug":"fawacka","avatar_url":"avatars/4119551.png?_=be0c83a8c144a75b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629474337,"body":"damn great body. but same basic lame plot again. facial expressions no to best but ye"},{"id":1959908,"gallery_id":369902,"poster":{"id":3802381,"username":"TheUnknownVoid","slug":"theunknownvoid","avatar_url":"avatars/3802381.png?_=c43ccc86eb69a683","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629471347,"body":"Holy shit that bodyyyyh"},{"id":1959865,"gallery_id":369902,"poster":{"id":1707370,"username":"ledresivan","slug":"ledresivan","avatar_url":"avatars/1707370.png?_=142c5860aaafdda5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1629469352,"body":"Need translation "}]
