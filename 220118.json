Apparently no cheating in the second chapter. I still don't know why authors think they need to add a new character to keep the series enjoyable.

Take a beautiful sole male sole female and dirty it in such a vile way. It's nice to see that their relationship is so meaningless to each other, that some random chick can have an equal value to his lifelong friend and girlfriend, whom he can't fucking seem to choose between.\n\nI also really liked the line \"don't worry about that, I'd have done the same thing if I was in your shoes.\"  You think for two seconds that both characters might be extremely dirty in their sexual escapades, but still have the principles to stay true to one another, and you get shot in the fucking face. She'd have cheated on him just as fast as he did on her if she was tempted a little.
