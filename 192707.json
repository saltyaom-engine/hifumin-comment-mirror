When Douglas came, I knew something is gonna go wrong but I never expected him to kill his best friend with one fell swoop! Even worse! He didn't felt a single shred of remorse after killing his best buddy since childhood and one of his only friend who would lend a ear to him every now and then. \n\nNow I'm not well versed in human psychology but I do get the notion of caring for the thing that's right in front of you and forgetting about all past events but this scene was really feels all over for me. It's not anything new but this kinda stuff really proves an individual's greatest amount of love towards another being so much so that, you'd do everything even bury your past events and forget all about them so that your loved one won't hate you.\nI also find what Giselle did afterwards kinda intriguing."},{"id":115916,"gallery_id":192707,"poster":{"id":957480,"username":"Futaknight","slug":"futaknight","avatar_url":"avatars/957480.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1493594668,"body":"I am not a fan of gender bender or yuri but for some rason i rally like this \ngood stroy and sex "},{"id":115352,"gallery_id":192707,"poster":{"id":1050241,"username":"ammirato","slug":"ammirato","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1493488002,"body":"I would have trouble eating the child of the only guy that cared about me from day 1, that I killed, even if he looked like bacon."},{"id":114946,"gallery_id":192707,"poster":{"id":1056863,"username":"Ravioli Makin","slug":"ravioli-makin","avatar_url":"avatars/1056863.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1493372555,"body":"Damn, when you are horny af but the plot is actually interesting"},{"id":113720,"gallery_id":192707,"poster":{"id":313349,"username":"hietsukuren","slug":"hietsukuren","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1493025607,"body":"Holy shit I've been reading this for over an hour"},{"id":113514,"gallery_id":192707,"poster":{"id":830454,"username":"Orpheus6732 SHSL lucky student","slug":"orpheus6732-shsl-lucky-student","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1492985522,"body":"None that I know of"},{"id":113408,"gallery_id":192707,"poster":{"id":1101058,"username":"zozazizuvip456","slug":"zozazizuvip456","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1492961562,"body":"So does is gonna have part 2"}]
