The only difference between this and the other upload (which I was unaware of at the time of my initial comment, as I was in the process of working back through the recent additions of the past day or so) is the placement of the scanlation group's credits page... And isn't that sort of thing usually supposed to be behind the official cover page anyways? Which would make this the appropriately ordered upload... It doesn't really matter, and I know I'm overthinking the matter, but it just bothers me, y'know?"},{"id":26489,"gallery_id":148606,"poster":{"id":34199,"username":"NullHorizon","slug":"nullhorizon","avatar_url":"avatars/34199.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1447015943,"body":"...Out of order? I've seen that tag before, but it hasn't always been accurate... It DOES mean the pages are arranged incorrectly, right? I'm pretty sure that's the case, but... Sometimes doujinshi just seem weird in their structure, y'know? Like, the proper order of progression flows a bit strangely as part of the author's style, or something... Either way, nice to finally see some English translated Tail-Red goodness!"}]
