It was my first KNY doujin and the best one! Because it made me wanna start reading doujins again and it made me ship them even more. It also brought back my inner fangirl! Even though I can't read Japanese but I still enjoyed it because the art is so good! It looks exactly like the official manga! The story is so wholesome and the sex scene is hot af! I can't stop squealing! >w< Seeing Tanjiro being the uke is my kink now and I never noticed he has such a nice ass! DAMN BOI HE THICC! Now I have to rewatch the anime to see if he's this submissive. Cause when I first saw him, I thought he was a girl. I guess he has a feminine side after all lol. Giyu also got that yaoi dick ;) Ah~ I love this GiyuTan doujin so much.\n\nFun fact: This is the first KNY doujin on MyReadingManga.\n\nHere's the Eng version: https://myreadingmanga.info/terepirin-goshi-douka-hone-no-zui-made-kimetsu-no-yaiba-dj-eng-2/"}]
