Not my fault you lied, how am i supposed to know..? I just popped in here, i don't know how your world works. Though, i wouldn't mind having some of my own fun with you...And almost all the other girls here. Haha. Though on another note, you guys got like a retro virus kinda thing that allows for genetic reprogramming of an adult host in real time thereby allowing adult specimens to be bent to the will of the virus? Which also includes a self kill code that forces the virus to become inactive after a certain amount of cells have been changed..? And a certain amount of replication too/resistance to mutation? Just asking, i am not happy with my genetic issues. And am also in need of medical care, as i have permanent damage from combat and could use your futuristic medicine right now...\""}]
