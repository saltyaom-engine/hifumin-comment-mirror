Turns out she also was quite sexually curious, using the meek Naoki as her plaything.\n\nIn the present their characters have inverted, and while he's quite popular and has a reputation as a playboy, she spend her days being almost invisible at school.\n\nWhen Hana stars dating the also shy Atsu, Naoki threatens her with exposing the past as well as her true nature...\n\nSo, in short, this is either a story on how a guy is getting his revenge for being sexually abused by Hana or Naoki always wanted Hana for himself, making this Netori.\n "}]
