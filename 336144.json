I follow them on Pixiv for their adorable Kantai Collection art, and I guess I saw a couple R-18 pics but dang, good for them for goin for it.  Too cutesy and loli for me but the more kanmusu the merrier.  \n\nBut I HAVE to solve the mystery of why this person keep scanning these at low resolution!  \"hurrrr scan it urself then\"  That's not an answer!  You know perfectly well that's not an answer and don't pretend you think it is!  Who is this enigma??? What kind of Martian psychology do they have where clicking a button to increase the resolution is some massive, exhausting favor they resent or that would make everyone spoiled, or what kind of bizarre, incredibly hurried circumstances are they under that they can't spare an extra 10 seconds per page for a conventional resolution?  Do they scan it at a print shop and take the files home on a 3.5\" inch floppy from 1992?  I have to know what makes them tick!"},{"id":1338115,"gallery_id":336144,"poster":{"id":3826341,"username":"Chilling","slug":"chilling","avatar_url":"avatars/3826341.png?_=685eeebdddbcb6cb","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1605429222,"body":"The watermark won't stop me fapping"}]
