Anyway I painstakingly adjusted the contrast and brightness of a few of them because they were being coy with \"darking out\" all but a few frames to make people want to buy it.  Kinda makes me sad that NHentai doesn't give back to the actual authors at all (as far as I know.) I'm sure they get decent ad revenue from selling our lewding preferences to the tracker networks and/or Uncle Sam. (Or whoever has the $) Kinda makes me wonder what Uncle Sam would do with stuff info? Save it for a rainy day probably, in case they need dirt on some seditious anti-patriot of some kind. Like me, but with actual influence. :)"}]
