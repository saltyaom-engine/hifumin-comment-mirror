Okiko Island has an exotic tradition, ritual to pray for wealth and safety. The secret ritual is done by infecting women with a parasitic worm that will make the women feel pleasure and crave for more. In addition, it also changes the physique to be more attractive, making them more sexy and keep their youth. There are two kind of people in the island, those with Oki (\u6c96, Sea) in their family name, and those who don't. The MC, Okishiro Kanna is a priestess. Her bloodline is strong enough to keep their mind even after ingesting the parasite. Her friend (an island girl, but not Oki) and her teacher (outsider) became a junkie from the pleasure.

When marrying, they got the procedure wrong, where the woman propose the man (it enforce that the 'right' way is for man to take initiative and woman as receiver) so their child is born as a boneless thing (Hiruko literally means 'leech child'). They drifted the child away to the sea before doing the marriage in the right way and give birth to other gods. Hiruko later return to myths as Ebisu, the lucky god of fisheries. Also, the fictional island's name in this story, Okiko, literally means 'sea child island', but with different writing can also means 'island to leave child'. The islanders consider their home as where the god was abandoned."}]
