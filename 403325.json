When marrying, they got the procedure wrong, where the woman propose the man (it enforce that the 'right' way is for man to take initiative and woman as receiver) so their child is born as a boneless thing (Hiruko literally means 'leech child'). They drifted the child away to the sea before doing the marriage in the right way and give birth to other gods. Hiruko later return to myths as Ebisu, the lucky god of fisheries. Also, the fictional island's name in this story, Okiko, literally means 'sea child island', but with different writing can also means 'island to leave child'. The islanders consider their home as where the god was abandoned."}]
