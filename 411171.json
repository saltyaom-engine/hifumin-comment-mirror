Seieki. Main plot of succubus fucking other dudes aside just protag... but not as good. The continued cheating post 5 year timeskip wasn't needed at end. Succubus Stayed Life is far better. ***** Starts out good, MC gets in a relationship with her and is constantly keeping her from draining guys. Forced along with some things. Then a turning point where MC basically getting cucked with them streaming it to him, Succubus nearly drains all three of them, MC nearly lets it happen and then snaps her out of it realizing he'd lose her completely. MC then fucks her real good and thinks he finally reins her in.... nope, post plot bit shows she's fucking around behind his back while married with a kid the whole five years later."}]
