Issue I got with them and these good for nothing shows (arguably only good for the porn that spawns from them and even then, only when it's not vanillashit, you get plenty of that in their shows where everything always works out in mcs favor and everything is given to them), is their delusional madness, on one side they praise the mc for every thing, on that same side they look the other way when mc is being a dickhead, on the other side, they get really upset when the ugly side comes out, the ugly side of something ugly in the first place mind you.
