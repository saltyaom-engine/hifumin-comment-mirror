You can have NTR where neither the MC or FMC are in a relationship but the MC has feelings for the FMC who may or may not return them. NTR is a genre that aims to create feelings of jealousy in the reader by having them empathise with the character whose love interest is being \u201cstolen\u201d away. There is the usual Netorare, there is Netori where we see it from the perspective of the one doing the stealing, and there is Netorase where the MC wants someone to steal their partner or would-be partner. The genre is a lot more fluid than people realise. Some of the most famous and popular NTR stories are about a main couple not in a relationship but who are friends. @akinlabi The cheating in this story isn\u2019t made to make us feel like the girl is being stolen away from the MC or us the main character, so it doesn\u2019t fall under NTR."},{"id":888829,"gallery_id":234213,"poster":{"id":1747394,"username":"EchiroEroHentai-Sama","slug":"echiroerohentai-sama","avatar_url":"avatars/1747394.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1556511547,"body":"This needs a sequel"},{"id":519601,"gallery_id":234213,"poster":{"id":1156419,"username":"chipsmouse","slug":"chipsmouse","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1527324838,"body":"How can you come to like this and actually put the effort into translating it"},{"id":519369,"gallery_id":234213,"poster":{"id":392762,"username":"machan12","slug":"machan12","avatar_url":"avatars/392762.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1527292761,"body":"@akinlabi all NTR is cheating, but not all cheating is NTR. Cheating is about breaking the bounds of the relationship, typically the bound of trust. This can be either voluntary or involuntary. NTR involves \"being taken from\" or, for netori, \"taking away from,\" 99.99% of the time against the will of the person targeted who is in the relationship. In other words, you, the audience member, are supposed to feel jealousy or anger in NTR, while cheating can provoke a range of feelings besides that.
