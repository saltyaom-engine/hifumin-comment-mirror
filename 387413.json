In page 8, when he asks why Rin is offering the ring to him, she said there are various reasons, but she can't explain it now (so there's probably another catch to the deal other than unable to return into male body), but what's important is if he will take the deal or not.

She seduced the guy, playing the kind of convenient girl guys would like, and they have sex. After that, the recording is leaked, and the teacher quit her job. Aoi also got another chance for the university recommendation. She thought, right now she felt like she can do anything, she can turn her life around, and leave this town. In the post box, she found another ring (Rin also got extra ring, so lets assume anyone who it changed, get one new ring to give the next person).

He thought, if he was born as a woman, he would have whore himself to get money and get out of his home. Back in school, his teacher informed him that his recommendation to university has been cancelled for other student. The teacher argued, because his family live on social welfare, it's best for him to enter vocational school and quickly join the workforce. With his future taken away, he thought of suicide, but Asui Rin, the artist, found him and gave him an offer. 4 years ago, she too was a male, but she got a ring that changed her into a woman, not just physically but also all the history.
