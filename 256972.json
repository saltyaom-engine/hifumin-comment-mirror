It's incredible, a fucking masterpiece of its own, looking from the bottom up of course. But still, me myself years ago and now still thinking of the same thing while seeing these Authors and their works: \"*facepalm*, please get help\".

Back to my point, this is just literally the Author talking &amp; acting to themself but with another \"person\" (2D Characters) image as their other's self, stripped all away what made that \"2D Characters\" \"themself\" and just inserted themself in just like \"Well, now i'm in here (the story), and also i'll be you now, living in your life\", remind me of -that- Story that is also \"body swap/soul swap\". Don't even wanted to -name- it for i refuse to even give it a spit of my own for its pityful self. Yeah you can say that this Story is something, i'll just say \"no\" and leave it at that for the undeniable fact that this story didn't start anything, it merely being an Amplifier and a Loudspeakers to spread the \"idea\" to more people and that's all to that bit.
