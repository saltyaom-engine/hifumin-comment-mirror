On page 5 the male protagonist laments a cost of 10 000+\u00a5 (1$\u2248110\u00a5) for what seems to be a theme park while he more easily forks out 30 000\u00a5 for a handbag (page two). Seems odd right? So I checked the raw and there the amusement park costs 10\u4e07 (\u4e07 being the symbol for 10 000-&gt;10\u4e07=100 000). This seems to be on the more expensive side but makes more sense than the inconsistency in the English version."},{"id":431400,"gallery_id":215642,"poster":{"id":113704,"username":"Tripple-H","slug":"tripple-h","avatar_url":"avatars/113704.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1524076830,"body":"God tier loli "},{"id":384904,"gallery_id":215642,"poster":{"id":1198602,"username":"CraterJones","slug":"craterjones","avatar_url":"avatars/1198602.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1520701234,"body":"Art was great but it was just sex throughout.
