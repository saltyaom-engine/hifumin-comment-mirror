Something I found funny is that the author focused on Takane's ass, which is a surprise because I remember that when Takane was introduced, the resulting joke among idolm@ster fans was that she dethroned Azusa as the girl with the largest breasts (Azusa's bust was 91cm and Takane's bust was around 95-ish). I'm guessing something changed in the interim or the author just really likes large posteriors and cannot proliferate."},{"id":2518437,"gallery_id":402790,"poster":{"id":2347966,"username":"Grandeur","slug":"grandeur","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1652320907,"body":"Some of these lines got me laughing instead "}]
