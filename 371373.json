This ones pretty decent, couple NTR/ish stories in here I\u2019m not a fan of. Chiguchi Miri\u2019s fat girl ain\u2019t for me personally. Nogiawa Kaede is turning into one of my favorite artists, shame their previous work hasn\u2019t gotten translated, and this one looks even better. Airandou delivers, as always, worthy of all the praise they get. Ponsuke delivering as well, swapping usually isn\u2019t my thing, but with Lolis, it\u2019s a bit more tolerable. Osanp Suisou\u2019s story was really slow, I have a feeling it\u2019s sequel will be fantastic though. Kinomoto Anzu was okay, nothing exceptional; Maeshima Ryou much the same, decent Rape story. Kyradains stories are still too vanilla and lackluster for me, shame too, since their art is fantastic. Overall it\u2019s above-average IMO, but not massively so 6 or 7 outta 10,  I\u2019m not quite sure yet.  See y\u2019all degens next month, or sooner, if we\u2019re lucky and these get translated ;) "},{"id":1986901,"gallery_id":371373,"poster":{"id":2293204,"username":"Nobita30","slug":"nobita30","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1630477949,"body":"Ah yes, Nekodanshaku and his perfect art"},{"id":1986776,"gallery_id":371373,"poster":{"id":413056,"username":"armjoe","slug":"armjoe","avatar_url":"avatars/413056.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1630472280,"body":"Good issue"}]
