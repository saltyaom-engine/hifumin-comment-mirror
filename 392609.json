She's a psycho using mental gymnastics to justify her actions, not a victim like you're trying to portray her. She even was ready to go cheat while her husband is in the hospital. Second part shows she will continue her cheating after the story has ended. If she really loved her husband, she would divorce him and move on to be the heartless cumbucket she always wanted to be, instead she continues fooling the poor guy and is using him as an emotional/financial safety net for later in life when her looks hit the wall and she's ignored by her sexual admirers. She claims to have guilt, but she doesn't actually seem or act like she does. An egoistical, deceptive, manipulative psycho slut through and through. Tomoki only exposed her true nature."},{"id":2361415,"gallery_id":392609,"poster":{"id":2564825,"username":"BZo1480","slug":"bzo1480","avatar_url":"avatars/2564825.png?_=3ff4cbfcb1167fd4","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1645858490,"body":"@jeje1989 Part 2 has been translated for ages now, lol.

I just read part 2. It's excellent. But while Tomoki/Kusunoki is a scumbag throughout, Otomono Main isn't a whore. She's a suggestible person prone to self-deception and moral equivocation. Nearing 30, she finds herself depressed and lonely in what seems an empty marriage. All of which is normal. On a deeper level, hidden even from herself, she's also naturally polyamorous and deeply kinky (her kink being submissive group sex with anonymous men) ... I find this manga interesting in that, while it superficially resembles countless other male-centric hentai stories about powerful alpha predators who \"break\", \"train\" and/or \"corrupt\" women, it's actually the opposite of that. This is Otomono's story. It's driven by her desires, and she's the only character who matters. Tomoki/Kusunoki isn't even a human being. He's just a plot device, the pseudo-magical agent of her transformation.

And Otomono clearly has options other than submission to blackmail ... BUT ... Saigado-san does a good job drawing Otomono Main as a character with needs she can't fully admit, needs the almost magically powerful Tomoki both exploits and fulfills. And I like that there's no mind-break or corruption (in this first volume anyway). Otomono is allowed to retain an unusual degree of agency and dignity for a female MC in a story of this type. Her love for her husband never wavers, and while she feels guilty about the affair into which Tomoki forces her, she's obviously getting something she not only wants but truly *needs* from it. Also lol at the internet heart attack pills ... It's generic and old-fashioned, but semi-credible psychology, nice art, hot sex, and a minimum of sadism/degradation put this in the win column for me. Not sure I want to know what happens next though :/"},{"id":2347926,"gallery_id":392609,"poster":{"id":263256,"username":"Dejavuu","slug":"dejavuu","avatar_url":"avatars/263256.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1645294039,"body":"Is everyone here stupid?"},{"id":2347818,"gallery_id":392609,"poster":{"id":416871,"username":"shikabane","slug":"shikabane","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1645291141,"body":"oh. finally"},{"id":2347815,"gallery_id":392609,"poster":{"id":119879,"username":"pftmclub","slug":"pftmclub","avatar_url":"avatars/119879.png?_=46d8b2e05cd3596d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1645291071,"body":"Fuck that shit"}]
