(This is my rough translation and interpretation, I'll place an imgur link to the short inquiry.)\n\n\"Greetings, Is your question referring to the latest doujin I drew? Within the doujin, there are a lot different Commanders working and living on port. While the ratio between Commanders and Ship-girls is quite imbalanced, there are a few lucky Commanders who are married to a Ship-girl. Eugen, who's married her Commander, is one of them. Eugen's Commander and Deutschland's Commander are two completely different people. As for names, the Commanders don't have any.\"\n\n(Link for proof - http://imgur.com/a/BjOPKKi)"},{"id":2093652,"gallery_id":376438,"poster":{"id":1995375,"username":"Ikemaru","slug":"ikemaru","avatar_url":"avatars/1995375.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634736654,"body":"Apparently, this blonde isn't the only SKK in the port..."},{"id":2086488,"gallery_id":376438,"poster":{"id":1835540,"username":"applesauce69","slug":"applesauce69","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634430946,"body":"Who\u2019s fucking eugen?"},{"id":2083948,"gallery_id":376438,"poster":{"id":3469423,"username":"ShadeLights","slug":"shadelights","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634331735,"body":"Page 8 lmao"},{"id":2082715,"gallery_id":376438,"poster":{"id":4046717,"username":"canislupus21","slug":"canislupus21","avatar_url":"avatars/4046717.png?_=b87edc684f887453","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634283549,"body":"Oh, much better translation this time!"},{"id":2080652,"gallery_id":376438,"poster":{"id":1875375,"username":"Han Xenomega","slug":"han-xenomega","avatar_url":"avatars/1875375.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634198377,"body":"YEEEEESSSHHHHH!!!!!"},{"id":2080482,"gallery_id":376438,"poster":{"id":3661253,"username":"vinvanselzer","slug":"vinvanselzer","avatar_url":"avatars/3661253.png?_=9174948f80fbcc14","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634191383,"body":"hm will we ever get a part 4? i wonder"},{"id":2079827,"gallery_id":376438,"poster":{"id":4046779,"username":"looloom","slug":"looloom","avatar_url":"avatars/4046779.png?_=6377cb0e26a330a8","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1634159790,"body":"Deutschland is 11111/10 and always will be.

And they say a hentai can't have a good plot. Honestly, I don't even see this series as hentai, just a nice story with sex scenes in it. It had a nice bit of comedy, a nice bit of drama, a nice bit off deep feels, and a nice bit of personality. The fact that it features my absolute favorite ship-girl from Azur Lane is more of a perk at this point. 10/10. Gonna be sharing these digits everywhere.
