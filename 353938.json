If I read futa on female shit, I don't want them go calling everyone a he. Main reason why I read this is because I don't want guys in my doujin. Its straight up mistranslation and bad for the doujin to express is it he or she at this specific case. An unfortunate thing which is lost in translation because of the way language works.\n(I feel the need to say that this has nothing to do with any of your gender identity politics cause surely someone would take this out of context.)"},{"id":1666116,"gallery_id":353938,"poster":{"id":1927208,"username":"aliceslewds","slug":"aliceslewds","avatar_url":"avatars/1927208.png?_=9961f3f43239f0aa","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1617817834,"body":"Page 8 literally sums up my sexuality"},{"id":1664525,"gallery_id":353938,"poster":{"id":1168948,"username":"Fookin Laser Sights","slug":"fookin-laser-sights","avatar_url":"avatars/1168948.png?_=51f64285b2765d14","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1617747843,"body":"Aww, a Little vanilla tag boi got lost here.
