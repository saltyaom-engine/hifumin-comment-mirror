A touching story, well drawn characters and a story that can be happening right now, not with zombies but with how we see the world in different ways. This could have been a twisted way that a kidnapper saw his relationship with the victim, love/hate that couldn't happen because of how the world had become. Unfortunately, the hentai part is really small and it doesn't show much so... 4/10."},{"id":1053913,"gallery_id":627,"poster":{"id":1642656,"username":"catstacks","slug":"catstacks","avatar_url":"avatars/1642656.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593857336,"body":"Love is like after the rain"},{"id":919694,"gallery_id":627,"poster":{"id":2470312,"username":"DemiseButterfly","slug":"demisebutterfly","avatar_url":"avatars/2470312.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1559091624,"body":"This is legit so sweet you could make a religion out of this"},{"id":556139,"gallery_id":627,"poster":{"id":1136753,"username":"Popon13","slug":"popon13","avatar_url":"avatars/1136753.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1529726334,"body":"I'm not crying you're crying..."},{"id":518668,"gallery_id":627,"poster":{"id":900506,"username":"qwerqertsadafcw","slug":"qwerqertsadafcw","avatar_url":"avatars/900506.png?_=4c0e319576ed8f59","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1527201717,"body":"Tragic...."}]
