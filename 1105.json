The first time I looked at them, I confused the girls and the guys for each other, not understanding why they suddenly changed positions, before finally getting that they were the other couple. That is also the reason why I usually like to see only one couple or a threesome if I is what the author wants. Too many characters get unnecessary and make it so that the author can't focus on the ones that matter. For example, that adult that appeared out of nowhere, was totally not necessary. If it were not colored, on the ither hand, I would be totally bad since getting lost on which character is what becomes kinda hard. Also didn't like that it was two stories. I came to see something and not that second work.\n2/10."}]
