With alot of the prequels having different titles. It's just this website doesnt know how to fucking organize it's books and has people just reading random stories out of order. The only reason I even know about this is cause I remember reading the first book a few years ago, There's like this whole back story about how they got their dicks &amp; how it can spread &amp; all that other shit. You can probably go to another site or look up on google the reading order for this @Aoi Ogata"},{"id":433722,"gallery_id":230941,"poster":{"id":1135800,"username":"Force Captain Catra","slug":"force-captain-catra","avatar_url":"avatars/1135800.png?_=550f551877b82215","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1524421653,"body":"This is just a random series that goes all over the place, but each chapter is worth the confusion."}]
