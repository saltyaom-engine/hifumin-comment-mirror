And you should not give even one cent, because if you do it even 5 years later, it's over and it'll bring it back to life.\nAlso, whatever kind of pressure and empty threats they put on you, you should endure it and not give an inch to them, and if they go really too far, you can sue them for harassment.\n(generally, for an oversea debt, they usually won't pursue it and the debt will be prescribed before some come reclaim it because of how long it takes to engage into internationnal recovery like this...)\n[part 2 is over / end]"},{"id":697120,"gallery_id":238543,"poster":{"id":414251,"username":"phantominferno","slug":"phantominferno","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1537946681,"body":"[irrelevant ; answer to TigaMaskman] :\nIt doesn't matter if someone take your passport, as it is just a piece of paper, you just need to go to the authorities and/or to an Ambassy/consulate to make sure they become useless and get others.

As you know, Japan is a country that everyone would want to go visit, study or work there. Some teenaggers who serious about that might go learn Japanese at cram school and in some horribliy-rare case, they met a con artist (who are cram teachers or students who related to prositution ring) who scam teenage students, claim that they have a relative there who can offer a cheap homestay in case anyone wish to continue studying at Japan. When they arrived and before they know it. Those assholes took their victim's passports and forced their victims in to slavery. Teenage girls &amp; boys who fell victim to this forced to sold their body for their freedom and if they can't live with it they would end up going back home with massive debt.
