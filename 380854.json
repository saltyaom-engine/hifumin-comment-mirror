In a way if not for her saving and raising her, the Succubus who beat her might have just killed her then and there instead of trying to entertain herself by forcing a \"Farmer and the Viper\" scenario where the chances of them escaping was valid! (I think the page near the end was the Succubus killing the Succubi who were watching in order to take the Samurai girl away! I don't know, but I'll view it as such). Feels like the Succubus story is a sad twofer where to save them, she had to become the \"Viper\" and now their relationship can never go beyond Mistress and Slave because she's always holding back that dark side that just wants to toy and eat the Samurai girl (she almost silped and let her fall to her death before catching her!)
