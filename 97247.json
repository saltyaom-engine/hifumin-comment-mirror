Comparatively, Nono had a more interesting loli personality than her. That's why when they brought her back but as an adult, my opinion of her vastly improved. There's something about a girl who's cute and who can potentially be sexy, gets all grown up that drives me wild. Especially if they go from a childish nature to a more mature nature. This is why she may not be as bae as top favs like Lucina, Tharja, or Cordelia.. but she's definitely not a weak contender at all.
