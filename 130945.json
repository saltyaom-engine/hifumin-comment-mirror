So he cheats through like what 12 volumes of this manga, his wife never finds out and he\u2019s portrayed as a good guy who loves and wouldn\u2019t betray his wife. At least in NTR, the person who falls is portrayed as doing something wrong. Here he\u2019s framed as as a good guy who just makes mistakes. Mistakes over 12 volumes, that\u2019ll never end in the future and the whole time the wife is thinking, what a good guy. She could get better guys than him anywhere."}]
