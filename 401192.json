The title in Japanese is \u9670\u30ad\u30e5\u30d0\u30b9 (inkyubasu), with \u9670 being pronounced as \"in,\" instead of being fully written in katakana as \u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e5\u30d0\u30b9. Though, \u9670 has a variety of different meanings, so I can't really tell you which is the correct one in this scenario with my own understanding. Guessing from how she wanted to use the toys on her ass, it could be the \"behind/back\" meaning.
