S Vol. 27 release, and I noticed that Senbazuru's improving his artstyle https://nhentai.net/g/241335/92/ it really looks a bit more stylish if compared to his older works, and Boi! Nokoppa is back and with another fantastic comic yet again, The way he draws facial expressions really adds more sexiness to his part, and damn those sex positions, for Palco and Kaeru pretty much their parts are the standard decent doujins, and as for Chieko I love the way he paired the characters, they fit so well together, so overall I'd give this an 8/10."}]
