The amount of time between when she thought he was dating that girl and them graduating was enough so that she would have heard something about if they were dating or no. That part is not so realistic, but people do assume things alot so that I'm kinda OK with. Her one in only idiotic move imo is that she got caught. She should have waited to do that when she got home, hell even steal what she wanted would have been better, but I digress. For a NTR I'll give it a 6/10.
