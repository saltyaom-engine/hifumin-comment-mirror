They\u2019re lucky either one didn\u2019t move on. Imagine eight years, that\u2019s back to 2013 from time of comment 2021. I hate these types of time skips in romance and hentai where both people don\u2019t even speak for years. Feels unrealistic and like a copout. Like it makes sense if one character is in a coma or something like that."},{"id":1193647,"gallery_id":327702,"poster":{"id":1299331,"username":"alonerone","slug":"alonerone","avatar_url":"avatars/1299331.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1599323644,"body":"They should had destroy that rapist dick"}]
