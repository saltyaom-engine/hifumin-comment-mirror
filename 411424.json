Even within the furry fandom, people cannot always agree on just what makes a person a furry or not.\n\nSome would argue that to be a furry, you must think and talk like one (i.e. use furry specific words and phrases). Even if you go to conventions, wear a fursuit, draw the art, writes the stories etc but don't talk using furry lingo, you're not a furry. Basically, someone that may walk the walk but doesn\u2019t talk the talk.\n\nOthers would argue that even liking anthropomorphic creatures makes you a furry. You may have no idea the furry fandom exists or have ever heard of a furry convention, let alone any of the websites; simply liking 'anthro' critters makes you a furry.\n\nThe way I see it, if or if you don\u2019t consider yourself a furry is a matter of personal opinion.\n\nAs with any hobby, most furries are normal people just like anyone you'll meet at work/school or going to/from work/school or anywhere.
