So Hinata gets advice from her friends who tell her to be bold and get her a sexy outfit. But Naruto doesn't want her forcing himself, which makes Hinata feel sad for not being able to met Naruto's needs. Hinata bumps into someone who flirts with her Naruto gets jealous so he drugs her to have her to himself and then feel guilty about all in all they both end up sad. I really need a translation for this as it is the reason I made an account and If what I said turns out to be the case I hope there is a continuation where it is all happily ever after.
