I'll just add some extra bits. The black hair dude is either an illusion or he was killed and eaten by the mom. Japanese fox goddess legends and all. It's ambiguous as the mom insists that he doesn't exist. The mom raised the kid for some sort of Hikaru Genji Plan. Also, at the end, she worries that her son saw her true form as she would have no choice but to leave him, however the son grabs her hand in his sleep and calls out \"mother\". This warms her heart so she decides to ignore the consequences, pass off everything as a dream, and stay with him as his mom.
