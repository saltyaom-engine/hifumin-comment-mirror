The story we got from this installment is probably a partial truth, wherein such savage Orcs did exist at one point or another, but because of the long-lived nature of Elves, only they have any memories of Orcs being such savages, where their \"present day\" cousins are just your average farmers. That or their race also has multiple cultures and Mr. Orc is from a different culture of Orcs.
