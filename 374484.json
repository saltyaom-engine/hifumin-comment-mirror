First of all, i dislike CUCKOLDING. Second, what love about the NTR tag is the FEELING OF DOMINATION. Lastly, I VIEW NTR WORKS AS THE BAD GUY. YES, I PLACE MYSELF AS THE BAD GUY, THAT STEAL/TAME OTHER PEOPLE'S WOMEN. THAT'S HOW I ENJOY NTR. The corruption tag is so heavily underutilized. It should be tagged for works with the girls changing their persona after getting laid."},{"id":2043001,"gallery_id":374484,"poster":{"id":1674198,"username":"Blankroom","slug":"blankroom","avatar_url":"avatars/1674198.png?_=8864db100bc6d34f","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1632658304,"body":"funny enough I think the first story woulda made as better ntr than w.e dramus did it's what you think it is only thing that's revealed I guess is that the wife was always a slut and her sister was a yandere for her and wanted them together and planned that.
