Our good old artiste there in Alto Seneka has hinted of a new Curse Eater Manga! He recently did the illustration for an erotic novel version of Curse Eater in Two Dimensional Dream Magazine Volume 111. In the blog post he made to announce this, he said \"soon after this, a completely new Curse Eater. Oops, can't say anymore.\" This tells me that he's working on a new work (which is different from the one shot we got earlier last year, since this blog post was made well after that one shot was released) and probably hasn't made any official announcements yet since he's hard at work with Aliens meet Girls. Be patient, and check the blog. The group is called \"Venom\" if you google Alto Seneka or Rusty Soul and Venom you should find the blog just fine. (I worry that links are against da rulez. If that is not the case, I will post a link to their blog later.)"},{"id":1270835,"gallery_id":318348,"poster":{"id":264776,"username":"EcchiFreak19","slug":"ecchifreak19","avatar_url":"avatars/264776.png?_=aa162209b22137a5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1602643946,"body":"Need more of that series... pls!
