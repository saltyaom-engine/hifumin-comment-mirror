The style is still there (just look at the faces compare this one with, say https://nhentai.net/g/389572/ (Sokushitsu \"Concubine\" series) or https://nhentai.net/g/389560/ (Ana Zuma series, which is even worse in this one, like as if the interns forgot to remove the tapes or whatnot on the edges), and you can tell that's Fuetakishi's style) but it is somehow degraded over time. Let's hope this old style comes back again."}]
