I remember watching many videos on YouTube, browsing fan arts, and reading fan-fictions on Tumblr and DeviantArt. Then I started reading doujinshis on https://myreadingmanga.info.\n\nMy favorite doujinshis are by Ichimura Hitoshi [RS/Ssize/Sam] (https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=3554). Because her art is so beautiful and each story is so well-written that reading them made me ship Sora with Riku. Ah, those were good times :)\n\nAfter I finished reading every doujinshi on myreadingmanga.info. I came here looking for more, but there are only a few good doujinshis here (this one included), and the rest have shitty art, or I already read from myreadingmanga.info.\n\nWhen I read doujinshis, I only care about 2 things: The Art and The Story. If one or both are shitty, then I'm NOT reading it. This one has good art, but I don't know about the story because I can't read Japanese, but I enjoyed it either way."}]
