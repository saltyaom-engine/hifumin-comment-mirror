Sis wants to experience love, but has no partner due to lockdown. So she chooses her brother, and her brother plays along, until she starts wanting to take a step further (sex). The brother is very reluctant, saying how after true lockdown is over she can meet other great people. But the sister says: \u201cafter the lockdown is over, all of this never happened, we will just pretend this never happened.\u201d With this as the excuse and that \u201cit\u2019s a big brother\u2019s responsibility to provide what his little sis wants\u201d, they have sex. At the end of the sex page, the sis says all this pretending to be lovers has made her actually in love with her brother (wholesome!!). The bro knows deep down that they can never just pretend nothing happened and things will never be the same. Last few pages: the bro wonders when the lockdown will be over, in which the sis responds: it will never be over, but having her bro is enough for her."},{"id":1317553,"gallery_id":335118,"poster":{"id":195867,"username":"Elitez","slug":"elitez","avatar_url":"avatars/195867.png?_=1bd3ad8eb5ab22ee","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1604607265,"body":"lockdown: exist ; \nIchihaya:"},{"id":1317329,"gallery_id":335118,"poster":{"id":3432307,"username":"WeebScientistAD","slug":"weebscientistad","avatar_url":"avatars/3432307.png?_=af8d11a1a4b7f3df","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1604598158,"body":"I pray to god when this is translated it will be wholesome.
