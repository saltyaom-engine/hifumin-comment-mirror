Some I would qualify as bad, most are pretty good, and a fair bit of them is really, really good (for example, anything that Shichoson touchs is gold to me). I discovered this one around 6 months ago, and I immediatly fell in love with it. However, since I hadn't been here for a long time, I decided to postpone my judgement until I'd gain more knowledge of the yuri doujin world. So, it's been 6 months, sometimes I still discover some really nice stuff, burried in lots of \"meh, that's nice enough\", but overall I think I can say that I've seen pretty much everything relevant to the genre, so I feel good enough to deliver my judgment: this is the best one I've seen. Sure, it's not really elaborate, it's not that long, but it is simple, it is happy, it is joyfull, it is cute, it is sexy, and to me, those are the things that really matter in the end. So overall, thank you to all of those who participated: 20/10 !"},{"id":1283525,"gallery_id":293434,"poster":{"id":1244652,"username":"Akizuki-Chan","slug":"akizuki-chan","avatar_url":"avatars/1244652.png?_=bbc8f783bf56f3ba","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1603213982,"body":"this didn't teach me the alphabet sad 0/10"}]
