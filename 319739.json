His art is ultimate.\nHi guys, I'm on a journey to translate more books. There are so many old books of my favourite artists that never get translated, so I would like to take this opportunity to do so (I'm sure many of you would love more translation too). If you're interested please check out my patreon site and support, would really appreciate it.\n\nTranslated by: HMC Translation\nPatreon: www.patreon.com/hmctranslate\ne-mail: hmctranslate@gmail.com"}]
