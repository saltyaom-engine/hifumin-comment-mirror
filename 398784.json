She wanted to quit the rigamarole of putting on makeup and dieting and whatnot to be presentable to society, evidenced by her nostalgia for her highschool days.\nBut then she sees the effort that those boys went through, also not because they are trans but because they idolize that ideal femininity that media can present, and desired to capture it and share it with others, even if only for a brief moment. To that end, Nobuo goes through his exercises and layers of clothing to obscure his masculinity during that brief time he puts on a show, even staying silent the entire time. It is not about himself, it is about the feminine ideal they brought out of the anime in the form of Elerin.\nThe ending is Rinko being inspired to renew her efforts, since she merely has to maintain what she (a female) already has."},{"id":2448415,"gallery_id":398784,"poster":{"id":1266230,"username":"Gudao's","slug":"gudao-s","avatar_url":"avatars/1266230.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1649551581,"body":"Hah...
