One, Maho and Mika are lover (i think?). Two, Maho remembered the drowned tank tragedy, because the rain, i suppose?. Three, it seems like Miho died in that tragedy if we look at page 12 (14 in the reader), but if we look at page 11(or 13) Miho was sitting in the front of Maho (i guessed it from her hairstyle), in a friggin' good health (well, she was crying, though). Four, Mika ask Maho have some sex, Maho refused because she's not in the mood because remembered the tragedy or maybe Miho, but they still having sex in the end with half-hearted Maho and made Mika annoyed (maybe). \n\nThe whole story in here is just Maho remembered Miho and the tragedy. And the sex scene is just like an extra, that has nothing to do with the story, if this shit had another chapter, be it prequel or sequel, this shit is clear. Yeah, the story here is started out of nowhere, and yeah it's a cliffhanger."},{"id":1679611,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":2668332,"username":"DustyKumsock","slug":"dustykumsock","avatar_url":"avatars/2668332.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1618463549,"body":"Where were u wen Miho is kil?\n\nI was at computer reading dough gin she when phone ring\n\n\"Miho is kill.\"\n\n\"no.\""},{"id":1624215,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":3504674,"username":"naniluffy","slug":"naniluffy","avatar_url":"avatars/3504674.png?_=7764f6e6083745d4","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1616002859,"body":"Like how tf are u loving ur actual sister, I\u2019d get it if it was step-sister or your actual brother but how do u love your actual sibling of the SAME gender as u?????????????"},{"id":1624210,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":3504674,"username":"naniluffy","slug":"naniluffy","avatar_url":"avatars/3504674.png?_=7764f6e6083745d4","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1616002715,"body":"This is why I\u2019m not rewatching girls and panzer the whole thing was so fucking cringe or funny bc of how bad it is"},{"id":1531452,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":1308907,"username":"kawaiiCENTURION/alice-chan","slug":"kawaiicenturion-alice-chan","avatar_url":"avatars/1308907.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611839328,"body":"wait so this is the part where miho jumped to a tank that is drowning and the what if scenario when she died...wow man this is sad"},{"id":1520401,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":3486291,"username":"Notice-me","slug":"notice-me","avatar_url":"avatars/3486291.png?_=c2c161753170f650","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611358673,"body":"Panzer Vor!"},{"id":1518022,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":2446622,"username":"thats a innocent frog","slug":"thats-a-innocent-frog","avatar_url":"avatars/2446622.png?_=1ceaa818668eb835","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611258185,"body":"If you don't get it she's talking about the Konami code you enter in order to unlock the hishashi-nora tank"},{"id":1514949,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":1669750,"username":"japanrain","slug":"japanrain","avatar_url":"avatars/1669750.png?_=381b5bee6cc8d5fd","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611125791,"body":"didn't watch nor read any of the original shit.. yet even people who did don't even get it lmaoo"},{"id":1513401,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":2486607,"username":"rudecustomer1","slug":"rudecustomer1","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611068983,"body":"Most random pair ever"},{"id":1512156,"gallery_id":344386,"poster":{"id":3695570,"username":"Kakegurui13","slug":"kakegurui13","avatar_url":"avatars/3695570.png?_=9baf900a98ff3c15","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611020565,"body":"Can someone explain please?
