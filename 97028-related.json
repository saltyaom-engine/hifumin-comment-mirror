I wish there was a story where Rito is engaged to all the girls that are in love with him, he isn't the king just yet but in training being like a space diplomat but we get to see Yami an Rito growing up to getting with everyone else. like yami finding out she's pregnant an being surprised an overjoyed that a living weapon/Assassin could find such happiness bliss with Rito + extended family/friends. I could imagine her to be I little overprotective of her child. I guess It would be nice to see how people would draw up a mother Yami an what kind of story."},{"id":897817,"gallery_id":97028,"poster":{"id":1923464,"username":"Ikki Yuuji","slug":"ikki-yuuji","avatar_url":"avatars/1923464.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1557288949,"body":"Love it!!! :3"},{"id":833966,"gallery_id":97028,"poster":{"id":2292294,"username":"Man reads book","slug":"man-reads-book","avatar_url":"avatars/2292294.png?_=20b4a59e7a393774","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1551600729,"body":"10/10 would nut again"},{"id":815400,"gallery_id":97028,"poster":{"id":2249411,"username":"dikhardvery","slug":"dikhardvery","avatar_url":"avatars/2249411.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1549980346,"body":"Wew, vewy nice, bust nuts multiple times.
