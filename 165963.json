This IS a pirating website since they just uploaded entire books that are legally only distributed by Fakku. They got the fucking rights and now they play on the legal playground. For example, I bought Love-Ridden on Fakku and when I compare with the recent upload here, there are missing pages and these pages have the Fakku seal on them. Guess why, genius. Fakku used to be a pirating website just as much a Nhentai, Pururin and a shitload of others, they just decided their fanbase was big enough to switch to legal. If Fakku wanted to sue Nhentai, I wouldn't give this website much time before shutting down or, at the very least, deleting all the Fakku licensed hentais. Nhentai is just not big enough to attract too much attention from Fakku for now."},{"id":48039,"gallery_id":165963,"poster":{"id":95542,"username":"vivendicrust","slug":"vivendicrust","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1465455308,"body":"Not tankoubon scan."},{"id":48020,"gallery_id":165963,"poster":{"id":71475,"username":"gesshoku01","slug":"gesshoku01","avatar_url":"avatars/71475.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1465445312,"body":"what ever the shit going on PLEASE tag these works properly."},{"id":48017,"gallery_id":165963,"poster":{"id":291066,"username":"Nagakura","slug":"nagakura","avatar_url":"avatars/291066.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1465443969,"body":"EcchiBunny, you know Fakku's an actual licensed US distributor in this case, right?\r\nThat said, I have no sympathy for them.
