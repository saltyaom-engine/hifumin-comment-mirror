Despite not being able to read it, I think I understand the mood the author is trying to portray. Even though storytelling isn't the reason we're here, you gotta admit, this shit is pretty clever. The distance emphasizes the casualness of the sex, and it lets us see the messiness of the environment. It's not up close like most of what we see in doujins. I believe what makes this so exciting is the realism of it. It's not like the crazy high school bathroom scenario we're used to seeing, its something that we, ourselves, could live through. I'm sure most of us live like this dude-living carelessly in a messy apartment or something-so putting ourselves into this man's perspective is super easy. Also, nothing beats a good vanilla :)"},{"id":581526,"gallery_id":240487,"poster":{"id":592071,"username":"ClayKaren1993","slug":"claykaren1993","avatar_url":"avatars/592071.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1532668531,"body":"idk, but why is something so casual like this is so exciting..."},{"id":581033,"gallery_id":240487,"poster":{"id":61732,"username":"thrasher123","slug":"thrasher123","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1532624960,"body":"I don't really know if the emotionless sex tag should be there."},{"id":580776,"gallery_id":240487,"poster":{"id":1837020,"username":"SilverSpooner","slug":"silverspooner","avatar_url":"avatars/1837020.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1532596961,"body":"Alright, seems like a pretty straight forward life"}]
