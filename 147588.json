In the final panel of the story on the bottom left you can kind of make out a second tail on Tsubaki. My interpretation of this is that she gained enough life energy from Daigo to incarnate with a second tail and a new personality. The original Tsubaki is the first tail, the second tail is this Tsundere version of Tsubaki. Also the artist has drawn her with a lot of tails so this could be how she canonicaly gets her 2nd tail."},{"id":2280158,"gallery_id":147588,"poster":{"id":609728,"username":"tamamonomae","slug":"tamamonomae","avatar_url":"avatars/609728.png?_=e65ebfd377ed84ff","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642777996,"body":"dude touched heaven but then fell back"},{"id":365148,"gallery_id":147588,"poster":{"id":398597,"username":"Protohentai","slug":"protohentai","avatar_url":"avatars/398597.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1518440305,"body":"Awoooooooo~"},{"id":42759,"gallery_id":147588,"poster":{"id":250963,"username":"Jarhud","slug":"jarhud","avatar_url":"avatars/250963.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1460971810,"body":"Next chapter  :D"}]
