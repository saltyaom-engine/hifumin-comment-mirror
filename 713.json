As a reader, I want to see another world, one in which I do not live and so, while not overstimulating the eyes of those seeing it, the pages must be full of life, even if it only is a few trees, that gives a sense of it existing. In this one, however there is the white background and sometimes a few things but nothing more. When I look at this manga I feel sad, like I am seeing a burned world devoid of what mad made special.\n1/10."}]
