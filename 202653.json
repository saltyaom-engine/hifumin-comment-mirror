I kinda picture this during the Boruto episode where Sasuke came back for a weeks after Sarada finds him. So I feel it does actually destroy her house in the Boruto series. Even the reference of Sakura destroying her house is accurate with the show right now. I also feel that the sex isn't rough because it sounds as if this isn't the first time they've had sex since he's been home. On page 11 Sasuke says she wet, but she answered saying its from last night. So this sex scene is captured a few days of already being home. So they've probably had the rough crazy sex. This doujin is purposely centered  around romantic sex. She did say \"I would like to feel like a beloved wife.\" So this is more of a passionate moment I guess. But I agree with the shadowing, its not easy to tell what's changing. The transitions need work, they don't lead well into each other well. And over all it is too short. BUT I still like this one. Love the concept."},{"id":384019,"gallery_id":202653,"poster":{"id":952084,"username":"XSegaTeamPhilosophyX","slug":"xsegateamphilosophyx","avatar_url":"avatars/952084.png?_=f10b24d4d6e7098b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1520562315,"body":"I do have concerns as to why does Sasuke still has his permanent Rinnegan in his left eye when he could switch it off, and why does Naruto's hair looks off when it's much shorter than that, also, Sakura's panty suddenly disappeared in one of the pages, other than that, I love it!
