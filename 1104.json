My real problems is with what I could understand form the story. I suppose that in the beginning they were talking about Dolly or something like that and it may explain the clone of the kid by the end. But what about the child overpowering what I assume is a teenager? She didn't really seem happy that she got raped but the child manages to overpower her and keep going. Also, that clone, that i mentioned before, seems kinda unnecessary since it came out of nowhere for no reason. Did the doctor create it or did it just spawn out of thin air. Nevertheless, a pretty good \"read\".\n4/10."}]
