The way anime style and comic book art in general draw young males and females make it almost impossible for anyone to be called ugly and everyone has model tier looks, unless they try to make them look fatter or exceptionally ugly. Drawing doesn't have many of the nuances of real life and everything is in perfect symmetry and shape. \nThough the author could have done more effort, if anything because the author have put more effort to detail the nose of the girl in the pic, the 'ugly' sister actually looks cuter.
