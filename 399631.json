Yes. But if you\u2019re reading this I\u2019m letting you know almost none of them are fully translated in English. Several of the series are only half translated. It\u2019s disappointing but what can you do. Unless you wanna pay a translator. These are really long series bro. Just wanted to give any potential readers a heads up just in case you really liked the style and wanted to see more from this author. There are very few complete English translations. In fact I only saw 1 that was finished. Multiple 20 chapter series stop half way. So you kinda have to be okay with the Japanese versions. This author\u2019s works has had TONS of translation requests in the replies for series that are years old and they still aren\u2019t translated so I wouldn\u2019t get your hopes up either unless you\u2019re going to pay for it :D"},{"id":2463446,"gallery_id":399631,"poster":{"id":4460116,"username":"Alsx","slug":"alsx","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1650158749,"body":"need englis plis"}]
