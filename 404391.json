I don't look at it like, \"Hey it's okay because it's a 300 year old demon or something\" or \"Hey it's not real so it's okay\". What I see is artwork, for example; if you see an attractive looking anime girl, are you comparing that to real women? Most people would say, \"Well this Anime Girl has unrealistic proportions  and no blemishes that make her look 10 times better than real women\". Which brings me to my personal view on lolicon, (again, not this one, the artwork is realistic) I like the assets. I'm not jerking off to the fact that she's underaged, I'm jerking off to the fact that there is a big fucking ass on my screen, the argument that, \"It's a child\" is so dumb, when people never say anything about shota content or even almost any cast of characters from an anime (mainly 15 to 16). So that's my personal take."},{"id":2549640,"gallery_id":404391,"poster":{"id":1738770,"username":"&lt;/&gt;","slug":"_","avatar_url":"avatars/1738770.png?_=d234c4e190a6562d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1653515184,"body":"pedophile at it's peak"},{"id":2549604,"gallery_id":404391,"poster":{"id":331696,"username":"benaret","slug":"benaret","avatar_url":"avatars/331696.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1653513944,"body":"Nice!
