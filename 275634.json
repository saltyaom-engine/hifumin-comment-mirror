I like romance stories and so I look most at the romance aspects, and somebody asking a person they barely know for sex isn\u2019t very... romantic \ud83d\ude05. Maybe for people that have different perspectives, the sex doesn\u2019t bother them. But I would like them to go through at least a date or two instead of immediately sex. Afterwards, they could have as much sex as they want. It could be a whole series with them having sex every chapter, and as long as there\u2019s still sufficient space allocated to plot development, I would definitely read it. But another reason I said this should be made a non-hentai is because that way more people will read it, and I want a lot of people to read this. It might be weird that I was so moved by a short hentai but it was touching.

I legit think the author should have made a non-hentai manga with the same plot; I definitely would read it.

But after death, he became a spirit bound to the world by his unsatisfied dream of winning a game of the sport he loved.\n\nHowever, as can be seen in one of the pages, the manga is set in a near-apocalyptic future where water levels have risen to levels that sink buildings.  In such dire times, and with little land to play on, sports naturally fell out of favor, and the guy had difficulty finding any tennis courts, let alone a person who played tennis who he could go against to satisfy his dream.\n\nAnd he finally met the girl, who he asked to hold a match with him to help him complete his dream and finally leave this world, and be reunited"},{"id":944829,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":1761286,"username":"hprince8","slug":"hprince8","avatar_url":"avatars/1761286.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560911275,"body":"so sad TAT"},{"id":944654,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":1945353,"username":"minnasan1000","slug":"minnasan1000","avatar_url":"avatars/1945353.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560898176,"body":"Thank you for story man! @Nice0506"},{"id":944199,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":1996070,"username":"sxczzl2008","slug":"sxczzl2008","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560868799,"body":"\u8fd9\u4f5c\u8005\u8001\u559c\u6b22\u641e\u4e00\u4e9b\u751c\u751c\u871c\u871c\u7136\u540e\u7ed3\u5c3e\u7a81\u7136\u60b2\u4f24\u7684\u6545\u4e8b"},{"id":943723,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":2505365,"username":"Tengentoppa","slug":"tengentoppa","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560828029,"body":"it's a great story, too good to cry."},{"id":943433,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":1857550,"username":"tuntoo","slug":"tuntoo","avatar_url":"avatars/1857550.png?_=6070acc289eeb67d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560802285,"body":"\u55da\u55da\u55da \u7d50\u5c40\u592a\u6c89\u91cd\u4e86qq"},{"id":942905,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":1369524,"username":"zxcvded","slug":"zxcvded","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560758828,"body":"what the fuck i'm trying to jerk off not cry and feel like shit"},{"id":942890,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":750694,"username":"qujhwfepiuqwh","slug":"qujhwfepiuqwh","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560757894,"body":"the man leave without kiss... even a hug\nand the last page girl was wondering if she told the man to stay what would he do."},{"id":942812,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":1552490,"username":"auramyaw","slug":"auramyaw","avatar_url":"avatars/1552490.png?_=c960c85a5f6fd27b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560751287,"body":"Such a sad story man"},{"id":942791,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":2017851,"username":"Jalape\u00f1o","slug":"jalapeno","avatar_url":"avatars/2017851.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560749424,"body":"This is so good."},{"id":942634,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":2020297,"username":"Nice0506","slug":"nice0506","avatar_url":"avatars/2020297.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560734777,"body":"The guy is a ghost,he want to go to heaven,but he has one last wish.\nThe wish is win a tennis match. \nAs time goes on,the girl starting to like him,but she know she can't let him stay,so she didn't tell him. \n\nFinally he won the game, so he disappeared. \n(Sry about the bad english.)"},{"id":942617,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":1779927,"username":"Eboun","slug":"eboun","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560732814,"body":"I cant read chinese too, but i assume they're having sex"},{"id":942544,"gallery_id":275634,"poster":{"id":1945353,"username":"minnasan1000","slug":"minnasan1000","avatar_url":"avatars/1945353.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1560727180,"body":"i dont read chinese so please someone tell me what happen?
