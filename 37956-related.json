And yet I still can't find it in English. I've found it in Spanish and translated it from that, and used the Google Translate app on the images, so I get the basic premise, but it's not the same. I know it was translated on one site but it was premium or something so not available for everyone. Oh well. One day I'm sure it will be translated for all. Maybe I'll pay someone to do it lol."}]
