Madoka and Homurachan both have a different universe for each of them since Homurachan ruined their home universe. I guess you can call it \"NTR\" but, it's just Madoka's, or what seem to be Madoka's existence. Since madoka can't physically be there and Homurachan can't exist in Madoka's world. So no NTR considerably since this is apart of Madoka,but yes since it's not Madoka entirely? It's difficult to explain but I dunno i tried to narrow it down a bit."},{"id":759632,"gallery_id":251950,"poster":{"id":1541374,"username":"TotallyNotIntoHentai","slug":"totallynotintohentai","avatar_url":"avatars/1541374.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1545149744,"body":"Is this like...NTRing yourself or...something?"},{"id":726833,"gallery_id":251950,"poster":{"id":1823199,"username":"JOJO666","slug":"jojo666","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1541435786,"body":"You are totally wrong dude...."}]
