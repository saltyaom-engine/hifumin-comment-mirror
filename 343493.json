Sadly too many people don't know the difference. As a result Shemale aka transgirl manga has completely swallowed the Futanari genre. actual Futanari (aka Dickgirls) have both genitals! (w/ or without balls) that technically makes them hermaphrodites. I'm not anti-trans or anything just saying the confusion has sort of ruined the genre for those of us who were into Futa doujins before the so called 'Futa-on-male' began to dominate the genre."},{"id":1536136,"gallery_id":343493,"poster":{"id":3271136,"username":"theunseengreen","slug":"theunseengreen","avatar_url":"avatars/3271136.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1612041014,"body":"Well well well, definitely would start using the train \ud83d\ude0b.
