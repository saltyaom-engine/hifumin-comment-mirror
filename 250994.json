Every heroine that is able to defeat a villain often faces another villain that is either designed after scientist guy studies their powers or are geared up to deal with them (e.g. like how the blue hair girl nearly annihilated the scientist in the earlier chapters but got destroyed by the red costumed chick from the bad guy side)\nB-1. Because of this they get systematically captured so the purple haired heroine allows herself to get captured to save them from within\nC. The villains apparently (or at least their boss) needs to implant eggs into people for offsprings which is what happened to the blue haired girl when she got captured before she was also thoroughly raped by the red costumed chick.\nD. Apparently they never understood what it meant for someone to get impregnated by the bad guy which led to this chapter where whatever was in there split her in half.
