Centaur! Centaur!\n\nIn response to SatoNargerame, I believe it's natural for us to like strength, healthiness, vigor, and intelligence in our partners; monster girls carry all signs of intelligence and health inherent to the human species, with human-like features enough to make us identify them as \"humans\", but also carry superior strength and vigor with their \"monster' bodies. It's the perfect fusion between humans and other animals. \n\nIn other words, monster girls are perfect, a cut above ordinary humans. The words \"out of her league\" or \"out of his league\" exist to describe the overall attractiveness of a human relative to another. In this case, even the human with the highest standard is still out of monster girl's league.
