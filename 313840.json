The trope gets old fast after the girl comic you realized doesnt even look thay different. They. also get so much more attention then other great artist and creators, liek they come with the same shit, different body type and get 5 animated hentais on it. If your favorite band or artist or genre of music came out with reh exact same sounding same looking peices everytime and didn't try and make something more imaginative and creative and out there for it so be exciting.
