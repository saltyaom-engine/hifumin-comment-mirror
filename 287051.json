Shinohara's love eventually prevailed and the moral was: Hentai logic is stupid. Yumi didn't believe in hentai logic but the teacher did. Also another lesson could be that, forget and move one.

But what happened? She was still obsessed with Jun cause he was her fIrSt LoVe. She didn't fully accepted Shinohara so a LOT of shit happened and Shinohara tried his best to break her. He finally manages to do it (The bet in #84157 at the end). As he was angry he forced (As her mind was broken she kind of just went with the flow) gangbang her for a year. She returned and reunited again with Jun. Shinohara went after her again and rebroke her (She couldn't go back after all the events, The evidence in #283883 shows she went nuts). After seeing Jun go away she couldn't hold on to the false hope of having Jun back. Shinohara used various stuff to make his dick perfect for the teacher.
