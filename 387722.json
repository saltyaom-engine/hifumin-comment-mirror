Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project."},{"id":2261979,"gallery_id":387722,"poster":{"id":3637164,"username":"Esas","slug":"esas","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642082479,"body":"very nice!"},{"id":2261686,"gallery_id":387722,"poster":{"id":2885263,"username":"VinylTavi","slug":"vinyltavi","avatar_url":"avatars/2885263.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642070331,"body":"Something about this just feels wrong, and I don't mean the aged down part."},{"id":2261623,"gallery_id":387722,"poster":{"id":1089656,"username":"KillYa008","slug":"killya008","avatar_url":"avatars/1089656.png?_=a042e9da1eff40cc","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642067767,"body":"Damn... it got real at the end..."},{"id":2261446,"gallery_id":387722,"poster":{"id":4408836,"username":"GamerJeroentje","slug":"gamerjeroentje","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642060800,"body":"Gekoloniseerd"},{"id":2261385,"gallery_id":387722,"poster":{"id":4069858,"username":"The Mischievous Gentleman","slug":"the-mischievous-gentleman","avatar_url":"avatars/4069858.png?_=1862f47404851cef","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642058827,"body":"This was quite nice \ud83d\ude0a"},{"id":2261335,"gallery_id":387722,"poster":{"id":3327050,"username":"Uryu senpai","slug":"uryu-senpai","avatar_url":"avatars/3327050.png?_=80536b30bca6598b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1642057129,"body":"INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE\nIntroduction\n1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries.\n2.
