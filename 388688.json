At least the romance between MC and Hanna was kept all the way and that was the only thing the author really stuck to and gave out a happy ending, even with a lot of loose ends/unresolved issues from other characters. Minji (I think that's the brown-hair girl's name(?)) didn't even have much of a story impact as she should've been (I bet she was supposedly the FMC but later scratched out). Overall, with all the benefit of the doubt, this is first story from this author so I'll give it an OK/somewhat fun to read; the best thing from this pornhwa was the art, it was really good."}]
