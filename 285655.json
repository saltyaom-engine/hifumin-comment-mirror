Like the MC in this almost got both girls exclusively in the end, but then at least one is cheating on him to do porn still (even if she still loves him) - the only upside is that she still likes him the most and is fucking him the most. Still sucks that its not happier though.   &gt;&gt;&gt;Also like the endings this author really likes putting horrible girls that ruin the FMC and MCs life for no logical reason. Fucking stupid.
