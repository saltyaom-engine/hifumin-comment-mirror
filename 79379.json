A fickel being definitied by some pseudo intellectual critics? No! It's something our hearts approach to. Something that speaks to us with the voice of divine creatures. Endou Okito is a marvelous artist and still he is nearly unnoticed. Many works of artist like him lay stacked like firewood. With no one to look after them, some even are rotting away. Art is mostly determined by the place of display or the demographic it appeals to.  No value spend to emotion or passion behimd it. Therefore thank you nhentai for letting me discover such a great artist. "}]
