I've been trying, but the tool I use to help identify kanji to translate is... being really bad with this. Plus my translations are only ever good enough for personal use. I wouldn't be able to upload them. But this has been proving frustratingly difficult. Maybe it's the handwriting of the artist's kanji that's tripping up the identifier."}]
