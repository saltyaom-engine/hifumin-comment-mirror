That eliminates whatever inconveniences you want to. It's not supposed to be scientific.\nI mean, there are other things that should get suspended while stopped, like sight, and gravity for crying out loud. And let's say that your body is unaffected by the stopping, so every force you exert is stronger. So kinda yes, kinda no sometimes you can move rocks easier because any ammount of strenght applied in very little time should move the object, but sometimes you would destroy the object. Also the breathing thing depending how it goes can be possible, but moving from point a to point b would generate sonic booms plus every time you change locations you would leave behind a vacuum that nature is not able to fill because time is stopped.
