That said, who knows what he will do? I just like reading his stuff cus its pretty hot and the art, so it doesn't matter if this keeps going or not, but it would be nice. (I really do like Mrs. Senpai here, even if she is a cheater :P)"},{"id":48201,"gallery_id":166146,"poster":{"id":417140,"username":"jowyblight","slug":"jowyblight","avatar_url":"avatars/417140.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1465574259,"body":"@a2payema i want to answer yor question but its hard to write with one hand."},{"id":48195,"gallery_id":166146,"poster":{"id":566667,"username":"xMadx Hatter","slug":"xmadx-hatter","avatar_url":"avatars/566667.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1465572603,"body":"TYTYTYTYTYTYTYTY *-*"},{"id":48186,"gallery_id":166146,"poster":{"id":566920,"username":"salahadinpl","slug":"salahadinpl","avatar_url":"avatars/566920.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1465568123,"body":"Thanks for new chapter but I am sorry for husband :("},{"id":48185,"gallery_id":166146,"poster":{"id":576464,"username":"RocksInAmazon","slug":"rocksinamazon","avatar_url":"avatars/576464.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1465567795,"body":"is this a continuation of the series or just another epilogue ?"},{"id":48184,"gallery_id":166146,"poster":{"id":231401,"username":"hentie85","slug":"hentie85","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1465566941,"body":"yeah~\r\nplease publish more Girls Lacrosse Club series author~"}]
