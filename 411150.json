Ringo and Kei are stepsister from their parents' marriage. At first, Ringo doesn't like him because her image of boys are creature who did things she doesn't like, such as flipping her skirt. But when Kei helped her, that gives her a new impression and for years she found herself not interested with other boys while she compare them to her brother. It's only recently though, that she finally realized she's in love. Her friend told her siblings like them can get married, so she planned on seducing him. Later, after the horror movie, she finally confessed she likes him, and how her seducing him is not just prank. He also admitted he loves her. After sex, they talk about when he begin to love her.
