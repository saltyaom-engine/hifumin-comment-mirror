In Megaten, anything not YHWH is considered a demon, from other gods, to even his own angels. Luna reminded me of the Angel (as in the bondage looking female ones who are the lower leveled ones in Megaten) in Strange Journey, in just how blood thirsty they can get in that game and alot of their dialogue when negotiating is pretty shallow of what they represent! They even show up in the first area that's suppose to represent human slaughter through endless war. Are even more blood thirsty during full moons. And they are the most prone to pulling \"sucker punches (sometimes a demon might start battle indicating they want to join you, but half of the time, they're fake outs that if you fall for it, they get the first round in combat as though you were ambushed!) But yeah, Megaten in that supernatural beings have no care for humans utter then what they can get out of them...which is never good for the human if their not careful...which they never are!"}]
