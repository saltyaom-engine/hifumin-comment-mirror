They've been having causally sex up until she says it's time for them to break up unless he ends up like his father (?). They get into a bit of back and forth when the woman ask him to rape her or end things once and for all. He really doesn't want to but he doesn't want to leave her either so he does. The woman had been raped a lot (I believe by his father or unknown third party? Not sure) in the past making her suicidal, non-committal, and sleeping around. She doesn't want to enter a relationship with him because she doesn't want to make him dirty like her or something.
