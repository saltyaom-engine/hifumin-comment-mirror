The group aims to gather commissioners to pool together money to get doujins translated. Often it is hard to for one person to justify paying let's say $30 for a doujin to get translated, but it is much more affordable if it's 10 people paying $3 each.\n\nThe discord group aims to create a large network of both people willing to commission small amounts of money and translators interested to make money on the side. The primary method of pooling will be through Kickstarter and once the target has been hit, any translator from the Circle Of Commissioners may declare that they will be working on translating the crowdfunded doujin. The pooled together money will then be paid to the translator once the translation is complete and posted on e-hentai.\n\nCircle of Commisioners discord link: https://discord.gg/UsK4xBJ"}]
