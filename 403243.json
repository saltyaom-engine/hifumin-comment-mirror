He might not be handsome, but he stayed by her side and is dependable. Him getting overboard with the sex is because it seems like the apps can't give same order twice (he tried asking her feeling for him, but back then she's still not sure about it herself), so worrying if the apps might stop working, he wants to savour all he could take now. Also, him talking with girls actually starts from them teasing about his relationship with Setsuya. As their family starts to settle down, she brought up about having second child. BTW, in profile, Setsuya is supposed to attend all boys school; so either the setting is inconsistent or she moved to Kazuma's school."},{"id":2528333,"gallery_id":403243,"poster":{"id":4825280,"username":"minminazusa","slug":"minminazusa","avatar_url":"avatars/4825280.png?_=2c643b9f9af2b709","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1652667566,"body":"The characters: Setsuya experienced a gender change. His childhood friend Kazuma stayed by his side. Lately, he starts feeling different. Kazuma's looks are just average, but he did get more used to girls from interacting with Setsuya, so he became more friendly with the girls in class. Seeing that, Setsuya realized she's in love and is jealous. She's also getting sick and vomited. After she confessed her feeling, Kazuma admitted he used hypno apps, and he will take responsibility. Time for interrogation of how far they went. despite all those things, Setsuya forgives and still loves him. About the sickness, they eventually tested and she's pregnant. But she won't abort the baby, even though both knows it would be a difficult path to take as they're still in high school. Time skip to 6 years later. They got legally married 3 years later, and he's been working to support the family.
