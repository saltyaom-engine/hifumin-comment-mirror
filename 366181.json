At most this is role reversal. Go read works by Hal, Oyster, a whole bunch of different authors into maledom stuff. Same content, only this is with girls. As shocking as it is, kinks are just all over the place. If you can imagine it, someone, somewhere, is into that stuff. It can't really just be explained. It's either your thing or its not. Also what is the point about talking about real life? We're here because we like this medium. It ISN'T real, its fucking doujins and manga, we're into it for various reasons, but the biggest one is its fulfills fantasies without anyone actually being harmed.  If you try to explain fiction by comparing it to reality, you missed the whole fucking point."},{"id":1880243,"gallery_id":366181,"poster":{"id":935775,"username":"[GM]OverLord","slug":"gm-overlord","avatar_url":"avatars/935775.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1626579828,"body":"?
