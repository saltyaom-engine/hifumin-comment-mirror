Two (as in the one fucking and getting fucked) is the best I tolerate as I do notice a dip in quality even with the best one because the artists has more to work on (and the best art, always requires more time and focus! So trying doing that when you have multiple more factors then if it was just two characters on screen!) as you mentioned with the panels! Plot is less hurt then the art and panels!
