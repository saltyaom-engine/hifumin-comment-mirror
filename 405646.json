In Arisa\u2019s case, she told him to jack off for her to get pocket money (she plan to sell the account after it got enough followers) at cost of leaving him with digital tattoo. The pendant can rewrite the target\u2019s perception, although it doesn\u2019t seem like he had any control. The first time, he\u2019s not even sure what happened. In Arisa\u2019s case, he\u2019s scared as she\u2019s trying to livestream it, luckily the signal is bad. At the end, the sister spotted him and told him he\u2019ll be expelled for indecent conduct. Hope the story can continue though. Feels like the expression is familiar, especially in p16.

It\u2019s the usual all-girls school just turned co-ed and there\u2019s only one male who passed the entrance setting, but as minority, he got bullied. The main perpetrators are Seira (the director\u2019s daughter, the queen there) and Arisa (a famous model and influencer, the leader). Hiroto, the MC, bears with it because his mother is so happy he can attend that school (she idolized the school) and worked hard to pay for him as a single mother. That\u2019s why he snaps off in p16, after Seira told him she want the poor single parent boy to leave the school. As for the pendant, he found it while organizing books in the library (got told to do the job as he didn\u2019t have any after school activity anyway)."},{"id":2569721,"gallery_id":405646,"poster":{"id":1595243,"username":"LordCellofEarth9","slug":"lordcellofearth9","avatar_url":"avatars/1595243.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1654365513,"body":"Anyone want to be kind to this one and give a summary of this story? (I get it's the classic male bully victim gets mind control ability or device and turns the tables on his female bully's, but I'd like a better understanding of the plot especially the end of this one if anyone knows! Thank You)"}]
