A handful of guys don't like their stuff, either story or art-wise. I don't mind the stories, they are nothing new to me, but I quite like Arakure's art. They aren't God-tier, and in fact, it's laced with tons of bbm, oldje (old man), ugly bastards and the like; but looking past that, it has a unique style that comes with a high consistency and clean expression in each of the panels that makes it quite pleasant to watch."},{"id":2550831,"gallery_id":404478,"poster":{"id":3520886,"username":"DATABASE","slug":"database","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1653563552,"body":"first com bitch will be always bi***"}]
