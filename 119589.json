The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your \u2018left\u2019? Or the one on your \u2018right\u2019? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first."}]
