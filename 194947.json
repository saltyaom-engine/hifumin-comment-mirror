So is when she was a teacher in training the first part and mochizuki's secret is the second part? The teacher in training part made me overjoyed since \ninui x mochizuki sensei was great and i like that ending but this story would be easier to understand if it was in chronological order which is not happening since its skipping to different time so are these mochizuki/other mochizuki and inui/inoue the same people or are these something advanced like these are totally different realities. Bcuz i didnt like mochizuki secret at all the shota's were fugly as hell and mochizuki sensei teaching training wasnsuch a great story and the ending shouldnt really be considered as an ending since inui was only a first year and at the end she was happy "},{"id":120428,"gallery_id":194947,"poster":{"id":242155,"username":"Wazzaby","slug":"wazzaby","avatar_url":"avatars/242155.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1495066151,"body":"can't believe is already translated... been waiting since I saw the raw a few years ago..\nthx a lot to the translating team and the uploader"},{"id":120426,"gallery_id":194947,"poster":{"id":576208,"username":"eromatsu2","slug":"eromatsu2","avatar_url":"avatars/576208.png?_=f7d14961a971e661","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1495065977,"body":"so glad to see this FINALLY fully translated!"}]
