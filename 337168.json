And yes, obvious she will have more NTR than other characters, remember that NTR is for cucks that like to have their beloveds stolen from then and Mash is just the perfect heroine for this in FGO because 1- everyone have her 2- she's always with you 3- she's loyal and lovable like a puppy 4- she loves you. Other servants can be a good target for NTR in FGO too but Mash is just perfect by peoples how are into it.
