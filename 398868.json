It's just an excuse for uploaders to get NTR past the NTR blacklists! Luckly I just started Blacklisting the artists/groups in question, or temporarily blacklist a tag till the the updates put it so far back the list I'll never see it again even if I skim through once I remove the blacklist! But seriously what's the point of the blacklist if those in charge of tagging and uploading (and I know they have to be the same individuals) refuse to respect it by trying to get around them! Now I'm thinking they can inflate the numbers of NTR read by tricking people into selecting them! Even if they don't read em, they'll still count as \"viewing\" them even to check the tags to blacklist...fucking Annoying"}]
