This doujinshi takes place in an alt version of the Remake Red timeline, as Zinnia simply never appeared in generation 3 and Courtney never interacting with Brendan or May in either the Blue or Remake Blue timelines. So, we know that you can safely play Sapphire in peace, as this has no hope of ever occurring there.

Why? It's simple, really. In the games, there are several timelines, which are categorized in two: Original and Remake. Games found in the original set include RBY, GSC, RSE, DPPt, BW, B2W2, XY, SM, USUM, and SWSH, while titles found in the Remake set include FRLG, HGSS, ORAS, and BDSP. The original set, which Sapphire is a part of, can be split into 3: the Red timeline, the Green/Blue timeline, and the Yellow timeline. Red contains Red, Gold, Ruby, Diamond, Black, Y, Sun, and Sword. Green/Blue contains Blue (or Green in Japan), Silver, Sapphire, Pearl, White, X, Moon, and Shield. Yellow contains Yellow, Crystal, Emerald, and Platinum. There is little difference between the Red and Blue timelines, save for the generation 3 games, Ruby and Sapphire. In these games, the plot is almost directly mirrored, with Ruby attempting to drought the country and Sapphire attempting to flood it.
