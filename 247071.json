This was literally just someone stuffing the doujin in a scanner and sloppily scanning it and then uploading it without a second thought. There is no sign of clean up work or anything to try and make the scanned pages be more clean and professional in there presentation.  Scanning isn't something that should be done half baked so if a person is not willing to do what needs to be done to deliver quality scans the probably shouldn't bother. I understand clean up is hassle and its even harder to do the painstaking work of carefully dissembling your own doujin so that its all just a stack of loose pages attached to nothing because thats just some of the things that needs to happen for clean scans to be produced.
