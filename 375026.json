But what I want to talk about is not the existence of condoms, but the problems of color and transparency.

I get the attempt to be realistic but condoms suck. Raw sex vs. wearing a condom is incomparable. It's like comparing a Triple A steak to a buddy burger from the dollars menu. I don't come on here to be reminded of how trash sex with a condom is. Birth control isn't even that expensive; I got my ex on it before. If an author wants to go for realism &amp; make it way hotter, go that route ffs."},{"id":2051322,"gallery_id":375026,"poster":{"id":3628744,"username":"Eistee111","slug":"eistee111","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1632993014,"body":"Thats looks like Hyouka..."},{"id":2051227,"gallery_id":375026,"poster":{"id":401066,"username":"dsfargeg","slug":"dsfargeg","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1632989191,"body":"holy shit "}]
