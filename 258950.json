Though I have yet to find a 100% identical reupload, most of the time it's for very minor tweaks that don't really contribute much and don't justify a reupload. For the problem of finding which copy to pick among multiple reuploads, I generally pick the most recent one since it has good chances of having been fixed and/or decensored.
