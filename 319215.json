Fuck HI3, the Support Team is just pure trash, and the Ban Hammer AI sucks AF!!! Just when you rolled for God Kiana and those shitties kinda CEs or cards or whatever, can't remember the freaking name. Fuck that game!!! It was the first game I spent real money on it!!! I dvdn lost the monthly subscription or that shit where you get like 300 daily crystals, gems, or whatever special currency it is. Yeah I'm salty AF when it's HI3.
