The more I read it, the more confusing it gets. As Hayakawa-san and Kuronami-san share the nearly exact some character design. Somehow I have the suspicion as if the author wanted to create a NTR and coming of age story with his beloved character creation but didn't wanted to sully his waifu creation and therfore crated a new look-a-like character to make something like a what-if-scenario but without pulling the plot device of the previous work, where everything in the end was just the fantasy of the mischievous pervert Kuronami-san."},{"id":2042220,"gallery_id":374490,"poster":{"id":4724925,"username":"nhcasual","slug":"nhcasual","avatar_url":"avatars/4724925.png?_=7e50b3620e94a829","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1632631354,"body":"@Feuerteufel Oh I see, thanks for telling me, she REALLY looks like her so I was confused"},{"id":2042177,"gallery_id":374490,"poster":{"id":3358169,"username":"Feuerteufel","slug":"feuerteufel","avatar_url":"avatars/3358169.png?_=e59dd767624caeb1","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1632630259,"body":"@nhcasual, No, the female protagonist of the NTR story is a new character called Hayakawa-san. The protagonist of the previous work was Kuronami-san. The volume is a little bit confusing as the special story about Kuronami-san bathing in the river and ending up masturbating was mixed into the pages about the story of Hayakawa-san, aka the slut who cheats on her boyfriend with some alpha. \n"},{"id":2042154,"gallery_id":374490,"poster":{"id":4598680,"username":"Pakito-","slug":"pakito","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1632629474,"body":"Translation would be interesting on this one.
