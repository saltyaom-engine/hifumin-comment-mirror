I don't know. I can't help but feel that it's still pretty vanilla considering it's by Crimson Comics. It really doesn't help after reading many of their mangas and playing their flash games... Something about their very noticeable art style (Like Tony Taka level) just screams vanilla in a way... Especially the very unimaginative situations they keep putting all ofthe girls through. Whether it's by rape or by tentacles. They are all so...bland and predictable... Can't Crimson do something more than just this all the time? Like Incest? Or NTR? Or even Pregnancy??? Anything to break their bland and obvious cookie cutter mold? Like you could go read all of their comics and there's not much difference other than slight different clothes, hair, and name of the heroines. And the villians I guess. But the rapey mobs on the other hand all looks the same... At least change up your art style, CC..."}]
