Except that scissor scene in ch1 which was a bit gory for some folks that can't handle it, it's pretty much yawning-worthy. Story gets to be fucking stupid, even those scrub employees are outright rubbing the maidens' face like a bunch of fucking little shit assholes that they are. Reading ch1 was already repulsive from lack of creativity, then came this ch2 and was like \"yo, stop, seriously, same shit again\". Art was alright but right now, this series gets a downvote from me, and fuck, I don't even like tentacles+rape any bit and gave this a chance, smh."},{"id":1929337,"gallery_id":361587,"poster":{"id":2263416,"username":"bapaklesbi","slug":"bapaklesbi","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1628348035,"body":"where is the ch 1?\n"},{"id":1883338,"gallery_id":361587,"poster":{"id":2312025,"username":"run00x","slug":"run00x","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1626691252,"body":"@Deepgazing1 Aoki san had lost his creative lost time ago.
