It's not easy but worth it. I would propably only \"fix\" something about my GF if it was something actually harmful. Like maybe stop mixing cocaine into your meth. Jokes aside there really isn't anything i want to fix about her.\nAnd if some kind of problem arises we just communicate it. Communication is so OP. We have been together for almost 2 years now and haven't fought at all. Not even once. We just talk about issues and solve them. Tho we didn't even have any real issues to begin with.

And like you said, people aren't dogs: you can't act like you own them, fixer syndrome is something real and even if you don't like certain behaviours from your partner, it's not your place to ''fix'' them.

I never thought of myself as someone who needed to be in a relationship, but since my last girl, I decided that I wouldn't enter a relationship with someone just for the sake of it. Maybe it's asking too much, but i'd rather be in a relationship with someone whom I can like as well as admire for their way of living, just like I did with my last GF (not the one with the disorder, I had another girlfriend after her). I don't believe relationships are things you should just stack you know? If you like sex, just do it casually, make it clear to the partner that you're not jumping the gun just cause of a one night stand. You should value yourself, your time, your feelings and be with someone who you believe can both get better because of you and that can better yourself. At least that's my point of view.

I thankfully dodged that bullet because I noticed that this wouldn't be something I could do in the long run and just remained a friend. She was just getting a relationship for herself. ( I guess in a sense most people seek out relationships because they don't want to be single. That's pretty normal. But she was on another level). The entire point of a relationship was essentially to be for her ,and she was pretty demanding. Whenever a relationship wouldn't work she would get a new one asap( gotta respect the grind). It got to a point where her mom told her that she would force her to take a break if the next one didn't work.

My girlfriend was nursing an utherine disorder that had began causing pain, so sex was a no no, and we were fighting a lot. I ended up meeting the girl whom I had my first time and had bonded before (not a date, we meet by accident), and things happened. Probably one of the biggest mistakes I made, purely for the feelings I got (which were nothing compared to what I caused her). And I agree with you, I too think cheating is the result of broken partnership rather than the cause most of the times - if I get pissed at a hentai, more than dumb hot bitches, it would be more about the partner having no guts or self-steem to retaliate or simply end the relationship. In the end that experience I had got me enough that I not just know about the consequences of doing something like that, but also what i'll feel afterwards, so at least I got something from it.

The thing is, I cheated before, and in the proccess I ended up destroying my ex's self-esteem for way too many months.

The feeling you get for cheating their trust is way too fucked up, and i'm not about to go and do the same thing to another person once again.
