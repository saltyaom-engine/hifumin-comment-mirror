Its the key to having a healthy relationship with any partner, independent of their way to show affection or how they like to have sex. I believe many couples end up falling apart because of fears and wrong ideas that could be solved with simple talks. Nice seeing someone with healthy ideas on such a platform - I generally find it kinda uncanny that people actually have expectations or ideas of what is sex based on porn material, which is never a good idea, so seeing someone who is good to debate about this side is refreshing.

It already was before I fucked up, but after that, it cemented itself even more for me. I know there's a lot of people who can forgive cheating (when the partner really regretted it), but i'd probably wouldn't be able to if someone ever did it to me. And like you said, people aren't dogs: you can't act like you own them, fixer syndrome is something real and even if you don't like certain behaviours from your partner, it's not your place to ''fix'' them. People in a relationship should be on equal footing morally like that, and trying to overwhelm them like they are just a toddler in need of teaching just shows how immature you end up being."},{"id":2428314,"gallery_id":397082,"poster":{"id":4787916,"username":"Janus22","slug":"janus22","avatar_url":"avatars/4787916.png?_=833bf37c984f760b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1648667379,"body":"@ScrubKing that story you told about the girl desperate for relationships is something I saw before too (and I fear it's very common). I never thought of myself as someone who needed to be in a relationship, but since my last girl, I decided that I wouldn't enter a relationship with someone just for the sake of it. Maybe it's asking too much, but i'd rather be in a relationship with someone whom I can like as well as admire for their way of living, just like I did with my last GF (not the one with the disorder, I had another girlfriend after her). I don't believe relationships are things you should just stack you know? If you like sex, just do it casually, make it clear to the partner that you're not jumping the gun just cause of a one night stand. You should value yourself, your time, your feelings and be with someone who you believe can both get better because of you and that can better yourself. At least that's my point of view.

My girlfriend was nursing an utherine disorder that had began causing pain, so sex was a no no, and we were fighting a lot. I ended up meeting the girl whom I had my first time and had bonded before (not a date, we meet by accident), and things happened. Probably one of the biggest mistakes I made, purely for the feelings I got (which were nothing compared to what I caused her). And I agree with you, I too think cheating is the result of broken partnership rather than the cause most of the times - if I get pissed at a hentai, more than dumb hot bitches, it would be more about the partner having no guts or self-steem to retaliate or simply end the relationship. In the end that experience I had got me enough that I not just know about the consequences of doing something like that, but also what i'll feel afterwards, so at least I got something from it. I guess that's why I'm more into wholesome stories though :v "},{"id":2423606,"gallery_id":397082,"poster":{"id":4544272,"username":"nihao1213","slug":"nihao1213","avatar_url":"avatars/4544272.png?_=2ad87a28c3ddbe9a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1648474020,"body":"\u6211\u8d85\uff0c\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u4e5f\u80fd\u770b\u61c2\u4e2d\u6587\u5417\uff0c\u5e95\u4e0b\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5168\u662f\u82f1\u6587\u8bc4\u8bba\uff01\uff01"},{"id":2422226,"gallery_id":397082,"poster":{"id":4787916,"username":"Janus22","slug":"janus22","avatar_url":"avatars/4787916.png?_=833bf37c984f760b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1648424783,"body":"@ScrubKing Funnily enough, I went through the same thing, tho it was way back in Highschool. The girl was in an open relationship with the guy, but in the end the two simply didn't had the same mojo from the beginning of the relationship - but the good memories made them stick even if both of them were already enjoying other people more. The thing is, I cheated before, and in the proccess I ended up destroying my ex's self-esteem for way too many months. We broke up simply because she was way too sad and I was feeling way to guilty to even try to get her up. The feeling you get for cheating their trust is way too fucked up, and i'm not about to go and do the same thing to another person once again. I don't see it as people identifying, and more as them being empathic: if a friend of mine gets cheated on like in a NTR, i'm going to get pissed for him.
