Like wtf. This isn't a dog. Anyways it works out ,kinda,not really. Some time later I hear that he cheated on her for very similar reasons as you did. She has some kind of medical condition and can't fuck (dodged that bullet a long time ago. I'm fckn neo from matrix. Btw Keanu is so hot#nohomo#questionmark) and thus cheater on her.

I thankfully dodged that bullet because I noticed that this wouldn't be something I could do in the long run and just remained a friend. She was just getting a relationship for herself. ( I guess in a sense most people seek out relationships because they don't want to be single. That's pretty normal. But she was on another level). The entire point of a relationship was essentially to be for her ,and she was pretty demanding. Whenever a relationship wouldn't work she would get a new one asap( gotta respect the grind). It got to a point where her mom told her that she would force her to take a break if the next one didn't work.

My girlfriend was nursing an utherine disorder that had began causing pain, so sex was a no no, and we were fighting a lot. I ended up meeting the girl whom I had my first time and had bonded before (not a date, we meet by accident), and things happened. Probably one of the biggest mistakes I made, purely for the feelings I got (which were nothing compared to what I caused her). And I agree with you, I too think cheating is the result of broken partnership rather than the cause most of the times - if I get pissed at a hentai, more than dumb hot bitches, it would be more about the partner having no guts or self-steem to retaliate or simply end the relationship. In the end that experience I had got me enough that I not just know about the consequences of doing something like that, but also what i'll feel afterwards, so at least I got something from it.

Yo imagine having a wholesome bonding life story exchange on this Plattform. \nThat's rough.i couldn't cheat on my partner tbh.

I just couldn't do it. \nSimilarly to how I wouldn't share my GF i understand that she wouldn't want to share me. And i think it's important that we can trust each other to know that there is no chance anyone could cheat. ( Although of course most relationships think that way. Even the broken ones ) .\n\nFor context what made you cheat ? \nJust youthful foolishness or had it deeper underlying problems .

The girl was in an open relationship with the guy, but in the end the two simply didn't had the same mojo from the beginning of the relationship - but the good memories made them stick even if both of them were already enjoying other people more. The thing is, I cheated before, and in the proccess I ended up destroying my ex's self-esteem for way too many months. We broke up simply because she was way too sad and I was feeling way to guilty to even try to get her up. The feeling you get for cheating their trust is way too fucked up, and i'm not about to go and do the same thing to another person once again.
