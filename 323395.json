The first part should had ended just like that but since it was so popular and people seems to like these duo characters, the artist continue this series until part 2 and finally part 3 here. Noticed that every parts ended with \"End\" instead of the usual \"to be continue\". Meaning it was not intended to be a series or some sort. So judging by her expression on the last page, we might be seeing this series continue, possibly the final chapter where she end up loving the fat boy.\n"},{"id":1126520,"gallery_id":323395,"poster":{"id":2255412,"username":"DoppioHD","slug":"doppiohd","avatar_url":"avatars/2255412.png?_=b697d7ac395f1496","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1596667790,"body":"My man become a broke because paying those thot"},{"id":1126375,"gallery_id":323395,"poster":{"id":2911552,"username":"Rurlock","slug":"rurlock","avatar_url":"avatars/2911552.png?_=d19477d7633e0437","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1596662410,"body":"Holy shit a sequel!!"}]
