(I think it is the latter)\n\n21 cont., ends with MC leaving to hand in a screenplay, with her making sure he has everything as he goes of, then attends to the crying baby that just woke up. With words about how they are \"playing\" husband and wife, (I believe it is playing on the fact she was an actress and he is a screenwriter, but basically they together, and she is now \"playing\" i.e. is, a housewife, and he is the working husband.)."},{"id":2249664,"gallery_id":316451,"poster":{"id":4126859,"username":"kidzhere","slug":"kidzhere","avatar_url":"avatars/4126859.png?_=888f79b869fc8c55","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641586667,"body":"Goddamn why, why the author not giving them a happy ever after ending why??????"},{"id":1886171,"gallery_id":316451,"poster":{"id":2946974,"username":"Bestie","slug":"bestie","avatar_url":"avatars/2946974.png?_=13515ba792b242a9","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1626800492,"body":"He Got her, and she Didn't even did with another one So , why is he crying or Thea Soe Happy kuda"},{"id":1012578,"gallery_id":316451,"poster":{"id":1062578,"username":"EXBD619","slug":"exbd619","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1592340954,"body":"This should really be a hentai anime series one day! \ud83d\ude00"}]
