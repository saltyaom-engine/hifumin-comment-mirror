(Aka A do not know C)\n\nA loves B, and B loves A. A and B dates.\n\nC secretly love B, B also loves C. \n\nD likes C a lot. D catches C peeping on A + B => D 'coerce' C into dating her.\n\nC still likes B a lot, so asks A and B to have sex, to relieve his crush. Agreed.\n\nB and C have sex. \n\nC confesses to B. D and A jealous.\n\nStill, B loves A more, thus she declined C. Much to A and D's reliefs.\n\nA returns to B, and C to D.\n\nIn conclusion, not so much NTR but... partner-swapping. Doesn't leave a terrible taste after reading it, doesn't feel (too) sad. So... Yeah. Almost vanilla?\n\nThey can even be seen later on in the omake fooling together!"},{"id":328949,"gallery_id":55620,"poster":{"id":1128650,"username":"p0209","slug":"p0209","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1511947778,"body":"This isn't NTR, the couple gets back together shortly (they could be seen fooling around with a vibrator, of all things, in the omake.)\n\nThat and it's more like a bunch of childhood friends swapping around."}]
