So that's my interpretation, the symbolism of the fireflies is meant to demonstrate the role of fantasy in the zealous human mind.

Hotaruko is no doubt caught up in the clutches of passion, aroused, turned-on, you know what the fuck I mean. Passionate love, or lust. But this is all imagined, remember we get an interesting line in the final page: \"The world doesn't work the way you think it does. You have to develop the power to do it just using your imagination.\" Hotaruko is able to develop something as powerful as passionate love as her sensei instructed through imagination. What does that mean for the viewer? What we can get out of that? Well, this is coming from me. I would say this ending demonstrates the role of fantasy in our day to day lives. Let me explain, shut up, let me explain, ok? We can't have everything we want. We can't have those lottery numbers, that sexy waitress, that passing test grade even though we might want it really badly. That's a normal part of life that is inherently inevitable for anyone with ambitions. Fantasy, however, can bridge that gap.

The title of the doujinshi is Firefly's Glow. In Japanese, firefly translates to \"hotaru\". In the second page, it's revealed that one of the girls' name is \"Hotaruko\" which if I'm not mistaken translates to \"Firefly Child\". This also happens to be the girl whose perspective we enter in the final page. Ok, firefly child. In Japan, fireflies are a symbol of both love and war as they are a metaphor for passionate love in Japanese poetry but their lights are said to be the souls of fallen warriors. This in mind, let's note that Hotaruko imagines Sensei's genitals as a light, a firefly if you will. As I said before, fireflies represent passionate love in Japanese poetry. Ok, are you following me? After having been forced to listen to Sensei having sex with the class president as well as the class president describing such in great detail, Hotaruko is no doubt- hang on, out of space"},{"id":1832073,"gallery_id":362864,"poster":{"id":4446071,"username":"MidnightMaraudersProgram","slug":"midnightmaraudersprogram","avatar_url":"avatars/4446071.png?_=9566f366d9d29a19","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1624664253,"body":"The ending actually fit the criterion of my previous statement except that there was no build-up to this scene as the comment below my first one mentions. Which is why it falls flat in my opinion, kinda. We don't get any hints as to what the final panel could be referring to or what it could symbolize nor do we get any characterization from the girl in the panel that hints at any underlying introspection on her part. This final page comes completely out of left field as if Amagappa suddenly woke up from his/her conformity and in a last ditch effort, put in something a little out there. And since there's no references or build-up to turn to when formulating a interpretation, like an ambiguous ending, the author is counting on us to fill in the blanks. We are supposed to come to our own conclusion as to what the final page could symbolize or mean.

Usually, the girls in Amagappa's work behave like realistic children in that the prospect of sex is sort of scary and unwanted. Examples being: Katei Saien, Kichigaigari, and Shinsei Gishiki. There are some exceptions to this though like Parent's Day, which is meant to be sorta absurd and comedic. But in Firefly's Glow, the girls are already oddly acquainted with sex. However, we do have the interesting, sort of fucked up premise which is characteristic of Amagappa's work, not only that but Amagappa fucks with our expectations as usual. You know, we see 3 nude girls in the first page that sets up an expectation that is intentionally squandered by the end. Besides that, things are a little straightforward which again isn't weird for Amagappa except that it's missing the twisted dark humor or in rarer cases, writing that is both poetic and ambiguous."},{"id":1820925,"gallery_id":362864,"poster":{"id":1294972,"username":"fossa","slug":"fossa","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1624247447,"body":"I don't get the ending.
