Not much of a new revelation, just a bunch of usual jealousy, sus scenes, you know it. If anything, Im curious what roll Masked will play in this story. At first, I though she's actually secretly dating Kise and she's thinking that Sensei's on the same boat as her, that's why she seems to be interested on what deal Sensei got with Karin. but I feel like that isn't the case since she seems to be unrelated to Kise with this chapter. Idk. On another topic, it looks like Karin's has been talking about Sensei to the two female students. They're friends after all. But it's not sure how far she's told about em.

Sensei noticed a very sus silhouette of Karin and the boys. He was about to go there himself but one of the girl says \"lemme handle this\". Looks like they're just painting. No problem. Karin's got the drip... well a drip of white paint on her face.

Out of jealousy, the boys grilled Kise saying he totally did it in purpose since he's a pervert. In the end, it wasn't revealed if it was or nah. Anyway, the two girls called Karin to join them instead of the boys which sensei was really happy for. Next scene, sensei moves to the art room and we see the couple from before yet again giving some panty fanservice. Unfortunately, Karin walks into it and she was definitely not happy. Next scene we see these two getting into a hot argument about today's incidents. You can pretty much guess what they're fighting about. When she said that she don't mind going public with their relationship, Sensei raised a big voice at her making her cry thinking that sensei might leave her. In the end, they made up and had sex in the bathroom. Amazing peeing climax scene. We see Karin getting horny as usual, she gets turned on hard when called out for being a horny girl. She even gives sensei a good licking up his ass. --"},{"id":2127079,"gallery_id":379148,"poster":{"id":2686247,"username":"DrinksandDame","slug":"drinksanddame","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1636171727,"body":"Itaiamai Ch 6 (p266) Summary: (1/3) Picking up from the previous chapter, school's busy preparing for their upcoming school fes.

Masked starts talking about those two but Sensei managed to show that he's not that interested about it which just like before, Masked is unimpressed about. Moving on, Karin and Sensei is having sex but this time around Karin's the one rambling about how she noticed Sensei's being a little friendly with Masked. How the turn tables. They managed to settle this peacefully tho. Next scene, we see Sensei with his two female students. Apparently, they seem to know something's up between Karin and Sensei since theyre her friend.
