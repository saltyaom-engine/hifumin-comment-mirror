Utter blasphemy that Rance will destroy and kill in an instant.\n\nAnd for the comment below, the reason why she's 1 year old is because in the Rance universe, Kalars/the species that she is apparently grows really fast. For some reason, in the span of maybe a month? She was born, grew to the size of a human toddler and could speak proper language. It's not cos she's special, it's a race/species thing. Kalars grow up really fast when they're young then they age really slow."},{"id":1454987,"gallery_id":116635,"poster":{"id":3357518,"username":"El exterminador de demonios","slug":"el-exterminador-de-demonios","avatar_url":"avatars/3357518.png?_=ac23eede517b8146","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1609607737,"body":"i looked at this character, how is she 1 year old, what do they mean by this"},{"id":746872,"gallery_id":116635,"poster":{"id":888529,"username":"StaroaX","slug":"staroax","avatar_url":"avatars/888529.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1543723051,"body":"\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 This is so cute, i really love it \u00a1please give us more! \u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661"},{"id":151533,"gallery_id":116635,"poster":{"id":521269,"username":"God Knight","slug":"god-knight","avatar_url":"avatars/521269.png?_=ec0db7bbd95b84eb","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1502549103,"body":"this man death for sure."}]
