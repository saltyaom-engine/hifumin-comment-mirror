Motchie's \"Mama Live\" series has a unique premise while also not starring any of the members of \u03bc's, that's very impressive.  The writing is pretty good as you can clearly see the mothers getting more and more desperate because they really want what's best for both their kids and their businesses.  I also really enjoyed how the shareholder was characterized. Definitely a great doujin and well worth a reread in the future.  "}]
