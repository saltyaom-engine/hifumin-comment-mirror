Kinda bummed to be honest. She's not any moral compass (she's the start of this after all) but her commander is also cheating on her too, and her friend is a piece of shit for doing what she did on mere suspicion. It'd  have been better for her to get away from those two instead of going back and trying to salvage a situation that's already pretty shipwrecked.  "}]
