So, did the events of chapter 3 really happen to Kou? Or was it all just future teen Alice's wet dream, inspired by her childhood memories of what she saw Kou & Nao doing in chapter 4? Or maybe a dream they both shared? We don't get an answer in the main storyline, but the omake chapter on pages 223 & 224 wraps things up neatly (if paradoxically). Here, having passed his exams and finally confessed to Chie, Kou is getting ready for college. He's interrupted by a visit from an in-between version Alice, who seems to be about 10 years old and clearly has a crush on him. Going through a box of old things, Kou finds a mysterious hair ribbon that looks exactly like the one teen Alice lost at the end of chapter 3. He gives it to in-between Alice and notices that she looks an awful lot like that \"Elly\" girl. Hmmm...

I think chapter 4 (w/ Nao & baby Alice, begins on page 79) is the earliest event in the timeline. Kou fucks Nao just before she goes off to school overseas. The timeline picks up a few years later in chapter 1. Nao has returned and is living w/ Chie. For 2 chapters, Kou fucks them both. In chapter 3 (page 55), Kou is visited by the mysterious \"Elly\". They fuck, after which she disappears, leaving behind a hair ribbon somewhat similar to the one worn by baby Alice in chapter 4. Chapter 3 ends on page 78 with \"Elly\" - confirmed by her unseen mother's voice as Alice - waking up from a sexy dream. Since this teen Alice is about to enter high school, we know that 8 to 10 years have passed since baby Alice's introduction in chapter 4. This would put page 78 about 5 years in the future from the end of the main storyline on page 132 (Kou & Chie happily ever after)."},{"id":1573724,"gallery_id":312173,"poster":{"id":1209269,"username":"Fire Wolf","slug":"fire-wolf","avatar_url":"avatars/1209269.png?_=0bedd1dd63c454f2","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1613685203,"body":"maan it has been a awhile since i have seen kikurage\nand it is still beautiful"},{"id":1374437,"gallery_id":312173,"poster":{"id":3363847,"username":"zombieadd","slug":"zombieadd","avatar_url":"avatars/3363847.png?_=87136af99411069a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1606785272,"body":"GACHIGASM!
