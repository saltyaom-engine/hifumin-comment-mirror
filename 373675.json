History will say you are wrong. Our law in sexual protection works now because we have way more population. More than 100k times the size in fact... So, we can start worrying about who can fk and who does not. If humanity has like 100k number left? The law will just be pointless. If they don't fk it's the end of humanity. \n"},{"id":2062451,"gallery_id":373675,"poster":{"id":1050655,"username":"InfinityKiyen","slug":"infinitykiyen","avatar_url":"avatars/1050655.png?_=b9679d8770164c96","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1633469005,"body":"@choloekaftan sorry but this actually already exist in the past. It's called the Medieval age and people there would even fk their daughter just because the population is as low as less then 100k in average per city. Impossibly low? Yes, that's what war does... Back then it was an endless war so they need any baby popping as much as they could. Meaning even child pregnancy. So, your logic is bad... If things were as bad as back then law in sex will revert back to the medieval age. It's not a fake too as it already happens in the past.
