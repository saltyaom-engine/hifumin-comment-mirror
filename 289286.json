We were talking in general gaming & life stuff. I don't remember how we end up on bullying topics, but I remember that one guy in the group said \"Girls' bullying is harsher than men\". At first, I wasn't convinced. How comes verbal bullying is more harmful than physical bullying. He said something along of \"Men will brawl the opponent to show who's boss when they hate each other, but when girls hate each other, they will try anything to get rid of the other opponent out of their way.\". He backed it up that he had seen it happened in his old school which was a case of social harassment. After that, I agreed that social harassment is worse than a physical one. And this story reminds me of that very reason not to piss any women off.\n\nI guess If this story was IRL, the victim could've blackmailed the bully to leave her alone, or she could've spread the bully's secret for revenge so that she would get expelled out of the school."},{"id":1002912,"gallery_id":289286,"poster":{"id":352046,"username":"Yumesoro","slug":"yumesoro","avatar_url":"avatars/352046.png?_=7c4335e855198db4","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1592056293,"body":"Won't drinking it again hust turn her back to normal?"}]
