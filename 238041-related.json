I read the first chapter and it... wasn't that good. Women fighting is decently hot and it had lesbian hatefucking, which I have to admit was pretty fucking awesome, but... What did we have after that? Characters out of no where, the character that was out of no where in Chapter 1 didn't even show up until the very end of Chapter 2. Then... lesbian netorare or something happens? And every chapter she gets her ass kicked against people I assume she won against? And was that car crash a suicide attempt? And the fucking bitch she fought before just so happens to be a nurse or otherwise get into the hospital to rape her? Then non-fighter girl shows up and something apparently happens - I just don't know nor care . This series is poorly done and a fucking dumpster fire. Why translate it when there's better hentai out there that is more deserving of it?"},{"id":560978,"gallery_id":238041,"poster":{"id":1515713,"username":"Nanaba","slug":"nanaba","avatar_url":"avatars/1515713.png?_=7fef29780d685a4b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1530255893,"body":"Still no translations....
