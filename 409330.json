Rather than like his previous yandere girl where all her face was with the black shades, this one only appears on a couple of pages, and the rest he used the eyes to convey her yandere characteristics. It feels better this way. There's not many artists doing yandere recently, even those favourites yandere artists seems to be laying low, so it's refreshing to see new yandere works from this artists. Hope to see more of them.
