Yuu or her senpai? The way it was \"narrated\" was kinda confusing. If by any chance if the one who was crying, tho it wasnt shown, was her senpai I have many question like what was the reason she was gonna date a guy? She looked like she was in love with yuu. Was it by any chance an arranged promise? Was she scared of the homophobic things people might say? Is it perhaps she was scared of what could may happen to them? Or after all she just wanted to have sex with her and that's it? Those are thing we will never know. Now if the one who was crying was yuu then there are no reason to ask why?\nSad story but she was able to find someone that will reciprocate her feelings "},{"id":768164,"gallery_id":113126,"poster":{"id":2133360,"username":".expired","slug":"expired","avatar_url":"avatars/2133360.png?_=d9c57a03af1b8c0b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1545998258,"body":"cool i\u2019m crying"}]
