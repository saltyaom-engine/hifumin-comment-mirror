The more people seeding, the faster it'll download.  You get the links to the \"downloads\" through either a magnet link which will download the torrent file and automatically start downloading from the link, or you can open the link directly and download from there."},{"id":109788,"gallery_id":132761,"poster":{"id":1081812,"username":"AnimeQueen","slug":"animequeen","avatar_url":"avatars/1081812.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1492012991,"body":"Yo, i download it but i can't open it.
