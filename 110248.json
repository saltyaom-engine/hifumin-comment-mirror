How does the character at the end know about the doll's experiences if it was just a doll? Maybe the doll was made after the scene in which she has sex with the male character - and it's more like a memento of when she was in the museum herself.\n\nIt was a really melancholic scene in the snow, though.\n\nThis is also an interesting manga if you think about the 'complaint' that's given inside of the story. Like, \"Men are not into pussy as much today\", is this social commentary (incorrectly) describing male preferences or trends? Is this just trying to depict a world where men are in fact not interested in sex and see it as an object in the background of more important matters? Like for example, when the couple was seeing a scene with two people in the bilboquet, and they're more occupied with the prize than the sexual act itself.\n\nThere's more I could think about this that can't fit in the comment restrictions of nhentai, well done."},{"id":705291,"gallery_id":110248,"poster":{"id":900506,"username":"qwerqertsadafcw","slug":"qwerqertsadafcw","avatar_url":"avatars/900506.png?_=4c0e319576ed8f59","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1538907438,"body":"So they were just dolls all along?
