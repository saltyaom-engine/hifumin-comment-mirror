Though her reaction to that is absolutely hilarious as she's selling immediately after that her \"friends\" to the rapist. Poor Glycine, poor Hanabi.  It becomes even more hilarious as she double crossed the rapists and feeds them to a tiger only to end also as tiger snack. Moral of the story: Crime never pays off."}]
