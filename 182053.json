There's plenty of panels where thats made obvious, and because of that she didn't report him and even gave into him after mistaking the Tomoe's confession to Gin. Gin always complimented Tomoe and thought he liked her so after the fake confession, she probably used her marriage proposal with the teacher to forget and move on from Gin. But I didn't see a ring on Setsuna's hands so its likely that she was only living with the teacher during her pregnancy until he changed jobs and had sex with other girls.
