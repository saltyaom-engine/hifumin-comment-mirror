I have i no idea why this reuploded didn\u2019t tag it as such, but the first upload did, you can check by looking at it. Now for the other two: I barely know the former so I\u2019ll just talk about the latter, and honestly, I have to heavily disagree with you, *Kyokucho* (that\u2019s literally how his name is read) and Michiking look nothing alike if you\u2019ve actually taken time to look at their works, and while Hisai has some similarities to both. Once again, the differences become apparent very quickly with time. Finally: all of them work with fairly different tags, Michiking has a \u201cPedo\u201d thing with Shota, Lolis, and a bit of Femdom from time to time. Kyokucho deals in the more an  \u201cauthentic\u201d side of rape/mind break (IE: The girl \u201cbreaks\u201d and just kind of lies their with dead eyes, as opposed to becoming some dick crazed nympho). While Hisai very, *very* much deals in story-centric Vanilla and only occasionally does Loli."},{"id":778764,"gallery_id":258886,"poster":{"id":1127570,"username":"Homosexual fire of the north","slug":"homosexual-fire-of-the-north","avatar_url":"avatars/1127570.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1546804393,"body":"Well, you see.......
