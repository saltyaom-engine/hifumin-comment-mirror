I'm getting sick of Netoare, NTR, and Rape always getting applied to a series where feelings are stated as pure as fucking day. It just makes me fucking sick to know that people are actually okay with this stuff. Rape is just an awful thing to think about and having to see it as a signature tag in almost 70% of hentai and hentai manga breaks my heart. 0/10 will never read again."}]
