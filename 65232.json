He wants to stop cross dressing. Now I have way more questions from this one though...\nIs this supposed to be a fantasy telling him he wants to be a girl? It doesn't seem like it's real since he never questions or acknowledges who the other trap is and how 5+ adult men snuck in. The fact that it seems familiar to him makes it confusing though.\nMaybe it's some split personality/repressed memories shit though based on the last page though I hope it's not cuz it was a rather nice story up till this one complicated it and potentially turned it dark. With the fantasy theory the black haired trap and feathers he is reaching for could represent his desire to be a girl. With the split personality/repressed memories though it could be him about to discover that he has those issues and it would explain it feeling familiar.
