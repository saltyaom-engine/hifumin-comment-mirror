Thats why often when they are asked about their interest in foreign men a lot of women express great interest due to modern Japanese culture making a large portion of their population unappealing to women."},{"id":2663615,"gallery_id":412351,"poster":{"id":73642,"username":"Fix your website, lazy admin","slug":"fix-your-website-lazy-admin","avatar_url":"avatars/73642.png?_=6294bf803e66a9e1","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1658793773,"body":"The only thing that changed from the previous upload is on page 37 where Madoka is now listed as being in middle school instead of high school.

Literally the one thing that it absolutely can't be,  is what the author chose. I've seen that parroted in propaganda efforts too.  FUN FACT: Nations  with low fertility rate like Japan suffer that problem because of WOMEN. Typically they become spoiled by corrupt govt giving them favoritism &amp; amenities against which most men cannot compete against so women reject/mistreat all of those men by default. It's women that are the bottleneck. That's why this  problem cannot be caused by 'men's lack of interest'. Ever.
