It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food.[1] Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many other nutrients,[2] including protein and lactose.
