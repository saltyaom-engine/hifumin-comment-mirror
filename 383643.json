It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid food.[1] Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many other nutrients,[2] including protein and lactose. Interspecies consumption of milk is not uncommon - many human beings consume the milk of other mammals.[3][4]"},{"id":2198326,"gallery_id":383643,"poster":{"id":4619292,"username":"THATAHEGAOTHOUGH","slug":"thatahegaothough","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1639466515,"body":"What the fuck did I just read"}]
