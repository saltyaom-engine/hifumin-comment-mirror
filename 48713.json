And, there are illustrators who work with Dal Young; Soo-Hyon Lee \uc774\uc218\ud604 (artist of UNBALANCE X2, Onihime VS), whose online nickname is Milkcow, and Gwang-Hyun Kim \uae40\uad11\ud604 (artist of Inferno, Freezing), whose online nickname is Eldo.\n\nIn short, yes, the authors themselves made doujinshi of their own characters!!!!!!! Isn\u2019t that awesome!?!?!\n\n(Yes, they traveled to Japan to publish this doujinshi in Comic Market. They make more money in Japan than in Korea anyway)\n"}]
