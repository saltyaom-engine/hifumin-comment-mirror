I don\u2019t know how many people played Apocalypse (Final is what it\u2019s called in Japan, silly), but I can hazard a guess that it\u2019s less than a million. Hopefully SMT V will rectify these low numbers, and SMT finally gets the recognition it deserves. I mean, Nahobino already sold me on the game. Here\u2019s hoping we can get him in a maid outfit, as well."},{"id":1793252,"gallery_id":323876,"poster":{"id":118460,"username":"RICH &amp; MARRIED RIOT FUJOSHI","slug":"rich-married-riot-fujoshi","avatar_url":"avatars/118460.png?_=cb9f1435a4158d42","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1623157334,"body":"I KNEW SMT4FINAL WAS FOR FAGS"},{"id":1134599,"gallery_id":323876,"poster":{"id":1960958,"username":"Otoka","slug":"otoka","avatar_url":"avatars/1960958.png?_=766d26d166f345ff","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1596992262,"body":"not an orginal it has smt charas from 4 and apocalypse but outfits be cute tho "}]
