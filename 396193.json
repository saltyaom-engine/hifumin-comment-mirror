The other girl is Kuroki Misaki, his junior. She's in love with him, so one day she tried a magic spell to switch body. After switching, Misaki broke up with his girlfriend (thus how pissed off she is in p8 and p28) as well as not wanting Yuuki's friends to approach his new girlfriend. As addition, Misaki's body is still very sensitive and got aroused even just from hearing his voice. Making it worse, Misaki doesn't have any family, so he's left with choice between going out with Misaki, or trying to fight for it (p22, he works everything to survive). When he tried to talk to his family, he met his hikikomori brother, who really hates him from inferiority and wants to rape his brother's girlfriend. Well, after that, he finally accepted Misaki's feeling, asks her to take responsibility, and they got married, with a child."},{"id":2404612,"gallery_id":396193,"poster":{"id":4387657,"username":"bbtank23","slug":"bbtank23","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1647732431,"body":"Sasuga Kanmuri-sama"},{"id":2403115,"gallery_id":396193,"poster":{"id":3580953,"username":"Damn that crazy over there","slug":"damn-that-crazy-over-there","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1647669161,"body":"WHAT THE FUCK"},{"id":2402678,"gallery_id":396193,"poster":{"id":4620581,"username":"WHO KNOWS LMAO","slug":"who-knows-lmao","avatar_url":"avatars/4620581.png?_=13fd923568fd5593","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1647652499,"body":"Idk but the girl design looks like saki YOSHIDA "},{"id":2401895,"gallery_id":396193,"poster":{"id":1558592,"username":"grandcam","slug":"grandcam","avatar_url":"avatars/1558592.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1647621651,"body":"Another top tier bodyswap h.manga"}]
