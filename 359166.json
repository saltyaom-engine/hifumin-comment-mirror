Normal women HATE men with overbearing ideals and a stubborn ego, yet somehow Shirou eats pussy for breakfast because he's the protagonist. Besides that, I agree with you on everything else. I just don't think we have the same notion when it comes to gacha games (once again, I haven't watched the FGO anime). Gacha protagonists are empty shells with no personality because you're supposed to focus on the waifus without him getting in the way. Now if we're talking about the average harem trash, then yeah, I also hate these pussy protagonists who apparently need to be a skinny boy with short black hair and a crippling fear of attractive women. But whatever, I'm rambling. We agree on almost everything and we can leave it at that."},{"id":1743142,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":1023945,"username":"Fadelz","slug":"fadelz","avatar_url":"avatars/1023945.png?_=ad39cf6e8409f95a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621185911,"body":"@iexpectedbetter prob shikibus diary or something she is a writer afterall, also the point of these NTR gacha doujins is salty authors who dint get to gacha the character so they self insert by calling support xD"},{"id":1742655,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":797633,"username":"Netorare06","slug":"netorare06","avatar_url":"avatars/797633.png?_=2a96afbc2305b988","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621169117,"body":"Aldyn: To each their own. I'm far more interest in a protagonist with a distinct personality and look rather than another copy of Kirito with the same bland face, boring design and empty gaze and personality. I don't hate Gudao, I just don't care about him. To the opposite of some losers bellow, you won't see me whining about him under his doujin, I'm just here for the NTR not him. Also, It's funny how Sieg took all this shitstorm when in the end, he has more personality that him. Still IMO Shirou was a good protagonist, he had a backstory, had a personality (altruist, hardworker, proactive) and when I played FSN I totally understand why the girls would fall for him. In the case of FGO, why would anyone fall for such a boring guy? It just makes the story and the girls weaker since you feel like anyone could do the job."},{"id":1742388,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":35030,"username":"foxdash","slug":"foxdash","avatar_url":"avatars/35030.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621159380,"body":"basic netorare story: crap and nonsense, but a total bait. meh! let's skip this one..."},{"id":1742337,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":1006911,"username":"2B","slug":"2b","avatar_url":"avatars/1006911.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621157294,"body":"Lmao crybaby bitches found"},{"id":1742241,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":1571575,"username":"Aldyn","slug":"aldyn","avatar_url":"avatars/1571575.png?_=6b1988a6df0a01d5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621154136,"body":"Also, kinda weird how you shit on Gudao for \"wasting money on stupid gacha games\" when friend-san is the one doing that lmao.

I haven't watched the anime, so all I know him as is a standard, silent gacha protagonist with no personality to be attacked. I'm always confused as to how gacha NTR is even a thing (like FGO, Azur Lane and Priconne), since the protagonist is literally who YOU choose to be. Where's all the NTR with Shirou, the most insufferable piece of shit of the Fate franchise? Where's all the NTR of Date A Live, Sekirei, Monster Musume, Haganai, etc? There's barely any NTR of those who ACTUALLY deserve to get cucked. I hate shitty self-insert harem protagonists with no balls as much as the next guy, but gacha protagonists are a different story. If you really care that much about a character that is literally supposed to represent the player, then 1) you don't understand gacha games, or 2) you're projecting your insecurities."},{"id":1741169,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":565676,"username":"Zastinx","slug":"zastinx","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621123644,"body":"lol friend-san"},{"id":1741124,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":1502610,"username":"Iexpectedbetterisretarded","slug":"iexpectedbetterisretarded","avatar_url":"avatars/1502610.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621122114,"body":"i did not get the ending, what is cuckamaru reading? a report of everything that happened or what?"},{"id":1740804,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":1499418,"username":"vaccinated","slug":"vaccinated","avatar_url":"avatars/1499418.png?_=ba187796f0b8f367","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621112581,"body":"read to p 4 but quit because so fucking stupid. does stupid continue, or does doujin end on p 5 w/ 16 blank mercy pages after? asking for a friend."},{"id":1740732,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":3947018,"username":"TJ456","slug":"tj456","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621110363,"body":"@Domagonic, ikr, the fact that his character is literally made to be a self insert and people hate him for that, like in the game his personality is based off of what you choose to answer, most people are just mad he has harem protag EX."},{"id":1740678,"gallery_id":359166,"poster":{"id":1922437,"username":"Domagonic","slug":"domagonic","avatar_url":"avatars/1922437.png?_=69c4ae8b3a67deed","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1621109006,"body":"Its great that Fujimaru-kun lives rent free in peoples heads, that gives me enough satisfaction to sleep at night imo.
