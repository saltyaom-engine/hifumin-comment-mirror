They are both aware and they both know they missed the boat. They both regret it a bit, as you can see on p41, but the only thing left is moving on. How does getting a bj and kiss make him move on? Because it kinda drives home that it's real. The faces he makes are basically \"that day, a part of me died\", so he can either kill himself more or try to cut it off and move on. Man, that p41 kinda delivers the final \"it might have been\" blow.

The Chitose he fell in love with was innocent, childish and cute but the one in front of him right now is a Chitose that will unhesitantly such another guy\u2019s dick while having another dick being thrust into her at the same time. In the previous chapters it was mentioned that Chitose probably agreed tl date the Gorilla because she didn\u2019t wanna be looked at as a slut who\u2019d have sex with someone she isn\u2019t dating but in this chapter we can see that Chitose no longer cares for such things and has already started losing shame. I do hope there is an extra chapter where we get a monologue from him that tells us what really motivated him to move on as well as a better constructed ending than this.

Kinda disappointed Hori and Chitose didn't set their feelings straight, since in the previous chapter she stopped him but at the same time didn't exactly reject him. A bit salty we didn't get to see some more Mika and Hori action since after the karaoke she invited him to her place for some lust relief. Hori going to a new barber is probably a way to show he moved on since he doesn't go to Chitoses place anymore (How does getting a blowjob and kiss from her motivate you to move on??). Also, the new girl joined the club because of Hori. I still believe Taka is a good guy despite being drawn as a douch. He even is the reason Hori got a blowjob from Chitose, since he told her to do it and the only reason he was fine with is was \"because its Hori\".
