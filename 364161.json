While this work has a regular plot, I enjoyed it because I prefer vanilla. Azur Lane is a great game, and so this was quite an enjoyable read compared some of the others. The art is pretty good, and so the rating is 6/10."},{"id":1838766,"gallery_id":364161,"poster":{"id":849875,"username":"Wolf of the Saturn Six","slug":"wolf-of-the-saturn-six","avatar_url":"avatars/849875.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1624921718,"body":"HMS is the truly Hot Maid Ships"}]
