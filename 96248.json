The ending will likely be the lie Taiga said becoming true. I'm honestly not sure I want to see the next chapter when it comes out because it would likely terribly hurt me emotionally. Most yaoi doujinshi I've read are extremely dark and emotionally fucks up the characters at the end. E.g. (Mentaiko, tt, Box, and shounen zoom) "}]
