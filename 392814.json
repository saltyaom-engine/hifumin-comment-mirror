Seeing how the final chapter and extra are pretty much the two girls acting completely yandere toward the male lead! Especially the extra seeing as they're pregnant with his child and they keep them heavily restrain so he can never Escape but looking at things where the hell would he go? I'm assuming they kept them in the lair for his own protection because before they were corrupted he was quite willing to endanger himself helping them and the tentacles showed they didn't discriminate on who and what they would go after male or female! But in this case while they were becoming enemies of the world. It's semi happy if Bittersweet LOL the girls are happy, and as usual with yandere ending. He'll be as well....eventually when he stops thinking and accepts the \"good\" them are gone! Only thing left is their \"now\" unrestrained love for him!
