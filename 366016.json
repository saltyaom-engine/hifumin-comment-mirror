Like in this one. He's  huge. He's hot. He looks a bit intense but he won't hurt her. And I'm an absolute sucker for these. So far the only one I can find are in korean novel and some rare josei smut here and there. Have you checked  ''Motoyan Nouka no H ga yabai! ~Tonikaku ore ni momaretero'' Its a really hot one as well.  Oh and '' Ichaicha Shiyou yo, Kumakei Kareshi kun'' if you want more agns't stuff.
