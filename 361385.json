He can't wait til the end of the main story to further imply that Michiru is a cock hungry whore who would fuck everyone as long as they flash their dicks. In a sense, he might think that these side stories are fan service, when in reality it's just... Lazy. Sorry to say. Well... The 2nd part is expected to be your average NTR, but I just hope that the wait will be worth it. Hoping that there will be plot twists that intrigues us to keep up with the series.
