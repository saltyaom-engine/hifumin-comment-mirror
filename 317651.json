Nah, he is like the persona5 mc, meant as a general idealized character for the japs to self-insert into, has way too much personality and is generally portrayed as flawless who is never wrong and always gets everything in his game, which comes off as if the entire game is his \"palace\" and you who payed atlus to play it and witness one of the ultimate wish fulfillment media in jap history where everything always goes well once he gets the persona main character's special snowflake powers. Can you really \"relate\" to a character who always gets their way and no matter what they do, they always get away with it for being \"the one who the author granted the highest plot armor\"? Are there others who can summon \"servants\"? only he or its sex inverted version (which for some reason has red hair and eyes) can summon/control servants, (that you can play as).
