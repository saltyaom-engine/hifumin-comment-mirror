Alisa is cute and I have no problems with her, but while she has been the closest to a main heroine, she is not the main heroine. In CS2, CS3 and CS4 if you do not do her events, she doesnt stand out more than any other member of the harem, and in Hajimari her role or her relationships are not relevant either. \n\nThe very fact that Rean has a harem with many options, each one of them being relevant in its own way, creating such a divided fandom, makes forcing an outcome with Alisa quite unsatisfying for the story and for the players. I mean, even until the end of Hajimari, being it the end of the Erebonia arc, there is no indication that Rean and Alisa will be together. \n\nOf course, there is the possibility that Falcom will decide that they are going to be together, but even so, any other alternative such as the harem ending, staying single, marrying Alfin and becoming emperor seems much more realistic."},{"id":2223001,"gallery_id":385130,"poster":{"id":2374921,"username":"shadowarrow","slug":"shadowarrow","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640560349,"body":"im still in love with emma tho lol so rean can have her and dont touch my emma or juna fie or musse haha "},{"id":2222845,"gallery_id":385130,"poster":{"id":761579,"username":"DANBREAK","slug":"danbreak","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640552892,"body":"Alisa is best girl, haters can seethe all they want because their trash taste will never be canon to Falcom."},{"id":2222840,"gallery_id":385130,"poster":{"id":761579,"username":"DANBREAK","slug":"danbreak","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640552738,"body":"@stenone cry about it"},{"id":2222787,"gallery_id":385130,"poster":{"id":1978742,"username":"stenone","slug":"stenone","avatar_url":"avatars/1978742.png?_=f882cd00cfba08dc","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640549583,"body":"I reject this route!
