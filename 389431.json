Ch.1, 2, 7 are same series. Mitsu, the girl, got something like Diarmuid's mole from Fate Zero. Although the story doesn't emphasize on magical aspect, men who saw her eyes fell in love to her. This had caused her trouble, like losing her friends because their boyfriend fell in love to her, or even getting assaulted by random men on street. She live with her grandma because her mother wants to marry again and is worried her new husband will fall for her own daughter. So, Mitsu starts avoiding people. Touya, had interest and starts approaching her. He's actually rather popular, but he said he won't date any other girl if Mitsu doesn't like it. After that confession they start having sex often, so much that Touya even thought he's sick. Hearing he said he likes her eyes, Mitsu finally told her story and push him away, but he persisted, and won't give up when Mitsu doesn't actually hates him.
