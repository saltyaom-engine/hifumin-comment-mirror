It's written like one of those old fantasy stories. Villain comes along and does a lot of shit, reveals their intentions, then ends up getting defeated. Especially with the story near the end, it was satisfying to see a feminist like her just breaking from orgasm. (No offense to Feminists tbh though.)"}]
