Husband gets cucked again. Hisako leaves him for her biological father. Takes the daughters. Daughters forget their real father and become incest twins with their new dad/grandpa. Hisako has a new incest baby with her dad that looks exactly like her. Shuichi or whatever the fuck the husband's name was marries the girl that started everything at the beginning of lustful berry and has a son. His son goes to the same school as hisakos incest daughter.  Basically the chapters coming out now are just milking the story and adding events that weren't previously covered like what hisako was doin after getting a job or what hisako was doing during a random week yhe previous chapters didn't cover. \nAlso the ending seems like a huge setup for the son to fall for hisakos daughter and get cucked again cuz she's about that daily sex life just like her mom/sister and dad/gramps.
