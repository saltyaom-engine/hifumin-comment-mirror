Naoya (the guy) had a crush on Mika (the blonde). A month ago, he swapped body with Yuu, and they tried to keep their life going. Yuu taught him how to care for her body, while she changed his image into someone more cheerful. One day, Mika, who is Yuu's childhood friend, told Naoya she had sex, with his body. As apology, Yuu offered to do make up sex. Since Naoya refuse, she suggest they start dating; besides, that way after marriage, they don't have to cut relationship with their own family. The next day, they told Mika they started dating, so Yuu can't continue the relationship with Mika. Mika is not satisfied, and suggested they continue the relationship, including her sexual relationship with Yuu (they already did it since both are still girls), and Mika does start to have interest with the current Naoya. Well, that's the beginning of their love triangle :D"},{"id":2211760,"gallery_id":384528,"poster":{"id":1955155,"username":"YuriBestLove","slug":"yuribestlove","avatar_url":"avatars/blank.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1640122435,"body":"Some yuri is better than none I guess, and this artwork is slightly hard to fap to....."}]
