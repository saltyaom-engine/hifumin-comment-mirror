There's no law in Japan that says what you can and can't draw. Selling it wouldn't be illegal either. Nobody is going to jail or being arrested for drawing fanart, especially in a country where selling toddlercon doujin is legal. They could get sued over it though. Now the ironic thing is that giving it away for free because you bought something else is completely legal and is EXACTLY what Pachinko is.
