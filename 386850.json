Mostly, you want Bennett just for the sake of his Q and full noblesse for the effect. The stats don't really matter. However, since Mona is more important in the reactions, it would be better to give her the better stats then grind for another noblesse set for Bennett. Even if its the shittiest stats like all def/hp, it doesn't really matter as long as his sands of eon is energy recharge. Additionally, since Bennett and Mona serve as support, you should really at least get a DPS for the massive hits and ideally a sub-DPS such as Kazuha or Baal to take advantage of the elemental reactions Mona is built for. Right now- there's the Xiao banner which I urge you to get although he isn't built for reactions, he's essentially a one man army. Diluc would be perfect for a Diluc/Mona/Bennett/Sucrose combination but then again, its all about gacha luck. nhentai has now become a genshin thread"},{"id":2247019,"gallery_id":386850,"poster":{"id":1055751,"username":"wibanbandit","slug":"wibanbandit","avatar_url":"avatars/1055751.png?_=17b03b8c9d4b5c86","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641488883,"body":"China nerf mona \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d"},{"id":2247004,"gallery_id":386850,"poster":{"id":274839,"username":"MyKatakana","slug":"mykatakana","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641488605,"body":"Yo i have C1 mona and want to build her but I already have Bennett on my team with a full noblesse set, what should i do?"},{"id":2246954,"gallery_id":386850,"poster":{"id":4526017,"username":"~Eros~","slug":"eros","avatar_url":"avatars/4526017.png?_=2648d8daa681f61c","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1641487548,"body":"Get mona\u2019d dawg "}]
