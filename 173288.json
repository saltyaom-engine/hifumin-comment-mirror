Also, the Japanese tag apparently takes priority in regards to determining which flag is displayed beneath the thumbnail, so if you aren't going to bother with keeping that tag off of the upload, there's not much point applying the english tag to it at all, since outside of proper searches, or checking the gallery regardless of language preference, it would go completely unnoticed. Is it really that much to ask for, that uploaded galleries be tagged properly?"},{"id":60428,"gallery_id":173288,"poster":{"id":732603,"username":"Tristan182","slug":"tristan182","avatar_url":"avatars/732603.png?_=eedd23ca5af4c68b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1473204768,"body":"Wow that got dark real fucking quick XD"}]
