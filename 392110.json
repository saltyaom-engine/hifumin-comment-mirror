It's been two years since then. I skipped it for so long that I forgot how to draw a sailor suit.\n\nFortunately, I'm fine with no corona. How long will the corona last?\nI have a lot of worries.\n\nRecently, my interest in anime has diminished probably because of my age. I haven't seen any in quite some time. It's dangerous. Why can I read manga?\n\nI've been playing games for a while. Witcher 3, Sakunahime, Earth Defense Force 5 and so on.\n\nSee you again. \""},{"id":2340896,"gallery_id":392110,"poster":{"id":1697082,"username":"Mtr13","slug":"mtr13","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1644982243,"body":"Wish they do more shotacon "},{"id":2340862,"gallery_id":392110,"poster":{"id":2328148,"username":"mccorny","slug":"mccorny","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1644980962,"body":"Same style again \ud83d\ude14"},{"id":2340709,"gallery_id":392110,"poster":{"id":96184,"username":"yuzuna","slug":"yuzuna","avatar_url":"avatars/96184.png?_=bfa333fd893a79f5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1644974277,"body":"one of my favs"}]
