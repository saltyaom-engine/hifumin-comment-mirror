Alter chickens out halfway through it,  I'm pretty sure that you're spewing bs when you say Jalter doesn't automatically have feelings for Guda. It was blatantly clear in nearly every bit of dialogue she gives us. She admires our resolve, our willpower, our tenacity. That was pretty evident when she showed up in the Temple of Time. She wouldn't have shown up if she didn't admire us to some degree. She saw that her original had the upper hand in expressing her affections for the person she already had feelings for, so that made her jealous and want to take more drastic measures, why? because she's Jeanne Alter. She also didn't think her plan entirely through in case that wasn't obvious enough from page 11.

Like seriously, use your brain for a second here. Jeanne and Jalter are based on the same person, but are definitely NOT the same person. Jalter is someone Gilles created usin a holy grail to be his perfect version of Jeanne, who later forced her way into the throne of heroes to be a summonable character. So there's literally two separate Jeannes in the throne of heroes. And yes this is NTR, you aren't automatically lovers with any servant you summon.
