It's a BIG turn off when there are as ugly than hell. The plot is interesting, really but this old fatty man is ugly and basically destroy the mood. I had to imagine someone else to appreciate this manga. I can watch and appreciate Deep Valley's work in term of old men but \"your\" picture, even if the women are great, you need more work on \"typical ugly old guy\" to make them more...likable?"}]
