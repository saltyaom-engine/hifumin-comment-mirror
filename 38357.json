Probably because back then I used to masturbate early in the morning and full color doujins just BURNS my fucking eyes everytime I read them. Another reason probably is that I got used to black and white that it feels when I read full color.  But I think the main reason why i hate it is because it makes the doujin more realistic. As someone who like reading loli hentai, I know that liking this type of genre can really have high consequences. So i try my best to just like \"doujin lolis\" and not \"real loli\".                                                     .TL:DR = Eye problems and fullcolor makes doujins more realistic"},{"id":2482308,"gallery_id":38357,"poster":{"id":2824147,"username":"Emiru Ikuno","slug":"emiru-ikuno","avatar_url":"avatars/2824147.png?_=d024fc5a08fab09c","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1650938726,"body":"Lmao.

Probably jumping to a high place is the best way to die without pain. Just make sure that you jump high enough that it can kill you instantly. You can also go head first to have a 100% chance of dying. Hanging is also an option but sometimes it will not kill you instantly and you'll still be suffocating for about 20 to 30 seconds.
