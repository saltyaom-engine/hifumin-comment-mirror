Probably jumping to a high place is the best way to die without pain. Just make sure that you jump high enough that it can kill you instantly. You can also go head first to have a 100% chance of dying. Hanging is also an option but sometimes it will not kill you instantly and you'll still be suffocating for about 20 to 30 seconds.
