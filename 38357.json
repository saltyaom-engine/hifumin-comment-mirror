Another reason probably is that I got used to black and white that it feels when I read full color.  But I think the main reason why i hate it is because it makes the doujin more realistic. As someone who like reading loli hentai, I know that liking this type of genre can really have high consequences.

Probably jumping to a high place is the best way to die without pain. Just make sure that you jump high enough that it can kill you instantly.
