First off all, the other girl, the one that at first died and now is alive, become even more irrelevant, had this been a story of slef improving and getting over a dead lover, she could have had a big part, the author, however, decided to make not only the consequences be the same as the first time, the girl that shouod die, died and the girl that should have died almost died too. The author just like with the first one, took back the consequences making me think that the other two chapters were useless.

This happening two times makes every other death not as impacting as the two would have been since now, I will think that nobody really dies, they just sleep for a while. The baby being a angel like the father was also a missed opportunity, if the baby was a human, it could have been symbolic to a angel, the male"},{"id":2016933,"gallery_id":256,"poster":{"id":2765976,"username":"P.A.
