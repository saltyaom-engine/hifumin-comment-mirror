I mean, it took exactly 14 months (monthly releases with 4 months of no releases if i counted correctly) just to get to where we are right now. Also apparently, many people are like on the waiting room waiting to see if the story's gonna go south at some point or not. Mustve been a long dreading wait, huh. Having all that said,  I think it's a good experience for people to have.

In other words we have entire year of setup and plot (slowly) starting to progress only now. Stories with long setup are good, especially with NTR, but reading it during ongoing publication just frustrating. So far we have setup for 4 roots (1 vanilla + 3 NTR), but zero plot.
