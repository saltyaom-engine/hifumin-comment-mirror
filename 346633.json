Last time I checked friends don't tackle each other onto a bed and ask them to only belong to them, nor do they hold hands while looking into each other's eyes and express their love for each other in the case of Riko and Chika. Save your Delusions for a shitty harem series instead of drawing lines where there are none.

Yishiko and Riko have little to zero interaction throughout the whole series save for one episode where they both like dogs, as for You and her relationship with Chika and Riko she literally gets shunted to the side by both of them. Aside from Kanan and Mari, Chika and Riko are the only 2 characters in Sunshine that have any sort of romantic chemistry between them.
