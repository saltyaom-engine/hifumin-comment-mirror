Props to the writer giving at grand total of 14 pages to set up the story and characters, compared to the total 8 pages of actual hentai. Now some may view this as a bad thing, and those people I would say are individuals hell bent on pure fap material and considering the story as an afterthought, although I may come back here time to time due to it being that good of fap material. The characters are set up well, and in doing so, doesn't make it feel as rushed as it should. Although I would say having the main guy as drunk ruins that whole set up but we can't have everything and it's in a decent enough way to it doesn't take away from the actual experience. \nI'd rate it a stable 8.7 out of 10, all aspects considered."},{"id":1020471,"gallery_id":298515,"poster":{"id":732603,"username":"Tristan182","slug":"tristan182","avatar_url":"avatars/732603.png?_=eedd23ca5af4c68b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1592608619,"body":"Awwww SHEEET :D"}]
