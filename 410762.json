Later he runs into her and she chases him and he thinks he's gonna get stabbed. She cries begging to start over and he rejects her saying she's going against the agreement they made during the divorce (no direct  contact or w.e).He meets his parents later who ask him why didn't she divorce him sooner. The reason is cus they always told him no matter what never divorce which they don't remember saying. They confess that they actually had a bad impression of her since when they met she did nothing while he was doing everything but thought she was his emot support. The interviewer comments this could have been prevented if they said so sooner. husband remembers the shit she said, how he was so strong and what is she to him making you assume she thought he didn't need her because he was too strong. So basically if he was there more for her and less perfect they would have worked out idk."},{"id":2645757,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":1674198,"username":"Blankroom","slug":"blankroom","avatar_url":"avatars/1674198.png?_=8864db100bc6d34f","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657984774,"body":"They all happen to be in the medical field (lawyer notes that it may just be a coincidence). Lawyer asks him to get more evidence to see if they can figure out how long it's been going. He finds her phone in her room where she's been hoarding expensive shit. He was actually considering reconciling but in the texts she talks him down like a failure of a man and wants to leave and how she'll be living alone soon (apt not divorce). He does the 180 leaving home with his shit cancelling his phone and sending her the divorce papers by courier. She gets it and starts freaking out and begging for 2nd chance through letters. One letter hits him cus it says how happy they were in the begining and he cries at work.

He paid for everything and still gave her allowance on top of her pay before she quit. She started going crazy with sex and blaming and rating the sex tearing him down a bit saying it's his fault they haven't had kids yet. Again she does nothing so he's tired from doing everything. She does some weird shit like reselling and buying her own shit idk i didn't get that part. She then said she couldn't concentrate in her own home and wanted to rent a one room apt and gets mad when he questions why she can their but not home and she uses the excuse he works and she's lonely to change the subject. Cat stuff happens. He investigates finds out he stole 10mil to rent the apt and was seeing multiple guys."},{"id":2642390,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":1261964,"username":"whatchasay","slug":"whatchasay","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657810047,"body":"Art look the same Akai Ringo"},{"id":2642112,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":1316047,"username":"ScTruF","slug":"sctruf","avatar_url":"avatars/1316047.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657793276,"body":"\u8349\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u4f86\u770b\u672c\u5b50\u7684\u6b38"},{"id":2640733,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":1820148,"username":"Sad doggy","slug":"sad-doggy","avatar_url":"avatars/1820148.png?_=093a9eb0a58c06da","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657731567,"body":"\u592a\u72e0\u4e86 \u5b8c\u7f8e\u63cf\u7e6a\u73fe\u4ee3\u5973\u6027\u5f0f\u7684\u5169\u6027\u5e73\u7b49\u2026"},{"id":2640202,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":3593535,"username":"\u30ec\u30a4\u30d7\u30de\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9","slug":"reipumansabisu","avatar_url":"avatars/3593535.png?_=d3b0a28eb9b0edad","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657706030,"body":"damn this art is clean asf"},{"id":2640146,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":5004239,"username":"hastur9921","slug":"hastur9921","avatar_url":"avatars/5004239.png?_=f652454a270cbac5","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657703470,"body":"\u80c3\u75dbQQ\n\u96e8\u8863\u5c11\u5973\u7fa4\u4f60\u592a\u72e0\u4e86"},{"id":2639799,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":5223956,"username":"Pumba12","slug":"pumba12","avatar_url":"avatars/5223956.png?_=52b6886e9d9761a0","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657687463,"body":"Seems interesting but she is a hoe "},{"id":2639683,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":2770998,"username":"aimanwhite93","slug":"aimanwhite93","avatar_url":"avatars/2770998.png?_=d166d2ef8fc7c75d","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657682492,"body":"i read this long ago in some raw manga website manga1000 but website dead now, it got 3 other chapter which is different story case "},{"id":2639580,"gallery_id":410762,"poster":{"id":2641472,"username":"NoxSphere","slug":"noxsphere","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1657678488,"body":"She cheated because he didnt have much stamina in bed and she cheated with three other guys?
