The \"ntr\" that happened here wasnt even bad or the worst ive read but its just fucking unnecessary and just makes you annoyed. And even worse was the end to the \"drama\" what did they do to the antagonist? FMC just says \"please forgive her\" even though she legit succeeded in mind breaking you. No joke even if this is \"a happy ending\" you can tell FMC will end up ntring MC again cause she legit broke at the end she even admits she \"lost\" to roberta.
