Happy because, you know, Azus@ttack is a really good series and is getting his 5th issue. Disappointed because lacks the development of previous issues, is just straight to sex.

The style was kind of shocking at first, but I like this one as well. Though it's nowhere close to the original of the 4 Azus@ttack, the art style looks much more rough, sketchy and false, which kind of breaks the illusion that the other 4 used to make, but also enhances the idea of the hentai d\u014djin as a way of fapping while scaping from reality. I mean, if I wanted to see real people I'd see real porn, which I don't freaking want to xD The art style is also WAY more agressive, it's MUCH more rough, which enhances magnificently the scenes of rough sex. Also, the anatomy looks completely simplified, and with the most important parts greatly enhanced, instead of showing everything as it could be seen, making things like the collarbone, the armpits or the feets much more appreciable, which is something I highly appreciate and strongly recognize.\nThough it's unfitting with the style the series has been building along time, it's not like it just doesn't work."},{"id":751269,"gallery_id":254827,"poster":{"id":1258861,"username":"skydelta","slug":"skydelta","avatar_url":"avatars/1258861.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1544201821,"body":"Uuuhhh....\nFirst of all, I don't mind with the tone.

It just needs to tone down on the whiteness, add a bit of skin tone and this wouldn't be that bad. I still like the past @ttacks, but this one isn't THAT bad it just needs fixing up.
