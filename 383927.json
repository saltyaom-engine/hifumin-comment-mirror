You're adding a number of doujinshis that is not untranslated(that's okay), but has a \"low quality\" word everywhere(wtf man?). I hope you stop on doing all this shit. I know it's ironic coming from me, on this generate site, to say this to you, but I will, get a life man. I hope I get to scroll without seeing any of your \"low quality\" uploads anymore smh. If you will continue, I hope you atleast get those \"low quality\" markings out. Peace bro. "}]
