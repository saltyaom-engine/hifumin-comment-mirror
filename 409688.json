The previous one even had it pointed out that the Hero's GF was \"so easily brainwashed\" that the villainess trapped him for gender bending corruption simply because she anticipated he would go the \"true love's kiss\" where he'd get corrupted! Frankly its been a while since Kouji done a Gender Bender Corruption (Of the Sentai kind, Last one with the Ninja Turned Kunoichi turned \"Sex Slave/Breeding Mare\" doesn't count) The Magical Girl one was okay (Part 2 specifically) but I'll always enjoy his Gender Bender Corruption more! (except the Vanilla Vampire One! That ending was nightmare fuel LOL! Prefer the \"Not turned into Vampire\" And \"Loli GB Corruption\" alternatives, cause at least the MC didn't brutally betray and murder his childhood friend and his family in those (Sad they remain separate though) for his own good but still, especially the \"Corrupted young\" Either way, better he think her dead, then waste it trying to save her in vain!
