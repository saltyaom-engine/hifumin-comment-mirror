There is a \"prototype/early beta incarnation\" of dragon maid somewhere around the internet (long since removed from CKS's pixiv, months before the announcement of the show) with early versions of the show's cast, one of those is oppai kanna (but with her hair down, horns &amp; tail different, still obvious). So all in all, it was just a matter of time before something like \"Ilulu\" showed up, it is the author's fetish after all. Straight away in the first season would have been pushing it, but after season 1's acclaim, they feel that they can get away with it.
