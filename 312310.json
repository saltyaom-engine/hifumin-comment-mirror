For the black-haired one, there's the name: Risa for the maid and Rinko for the president. Also, the president has a beauty mark under her left eye, while the maid does not. The blonde-haired one is a bit harder to say if there's any difference, but I think I have it. Of course there's the name change, with Alicia for the maid and Akame for the teacher. Now, the teacher could be the same person, but i think that if only one of the two main females remained, then it wouldn't make much sense. That's why i think those are two different people compared to the two in the main story."},{"id":1512674,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":3063453,"username":"lyzascarlet","slug":"lyzascarlet","avatar_url":"avatars/3063453.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1611039018,"body":"The art is 100"},{"id":1459544,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":3841386,"username":"kingdegenerate","slug":"kingdegenerate","avatar_url":"avatars/3841386.png?_=3d66a7e77bf8c350","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1609734691,"body":"wait are the ones in the ending different from the ones in the start??"},{"id":1328533,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":2503263,"username":"frostytips234","slug":"frostytips234","avatar_url":"avatars/2503263.png?_=e7c3433a93f15743","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1605047959,"body":"I wish the author would make an epilogue with the Japanese guy and rinko and sensei as well "},{"id":1248988,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":3628917,"username":"yurama12","slug":"yurama12","avatar_url":"avatars/3628917.png?_=3c6696285cc0ed51","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1601689089,"body":"The end is kinda, you know."},{"id":1176925,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":1202548,"username":"gxwild5","slug":"gxwild5","avatar_url":"avatars/1202548.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1598611111,"body":"Seitokaicho!!!!"},{"id":1147217,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":2991459,"username":"\u3084\u308c\u3084\u308c","slug":"yareyare","avatar_url":"avatars/2991459.png?_=5cb017c0dbad5faf","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1597477287,"body":"Bruhhh wth why\u2019d it have to end like that it was going good smh"},{"id":1121091,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":3361066,"username":"Cunnyseur","slug":"cunnyseur","avatar_url":"avatars/3361066.png?_=d22564072410414b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1596437237,"body":"You could say he rejected his humanity"},{"id":1054004,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":2164819,"username":"Maiden Slayer","slug":"maiden-slayer","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1593862294,"body":"The student council president leaving was such a waste"}]
