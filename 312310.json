For the black-haired one, there's the name: Risa for the maid and Rinko for the president. Also, the president has a beauty mark under her left eye, while the maid does not. The blonde-haired one is a bit harder to say if there's any difference, but I think I have it. Of course there's the name change, with Alicia for the maid and Akame for the teacher. Now, the teacher could be the same person, but i think that if only one of the two main females remained, then it wouldn't make much sense. That's why i think those are two different people compared to the two in the main story."},{"id":1576315,"gallery_id":312310,"poster":{"id":2597083,"username":"Vxn","slug":"vxn","avatar_url":"avatars/2597083.png?_=5c62f090f2a4d15b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1613815076,"body":"Why did he fuck up the ending so bad ????
