Zeus is having sexual relations with his older sister, Hades and meanwhile holds a tournament among the rest of his family. Which includes his other sisters and half-sisters, forcing even those bound by a vow of virginity such as Artemis and Hestia into having sex and then Aphrodite, Hermes, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Persephone (The twins, Perse & Phone in this story's case), Hephaestus, Ares and Dionysus are all half-siblings some of them actual siblings in the case of Artemis and Apollo. Meaning these two chapters consist of half-sisters and daughters of Zeus, Aphrodite and Hermes fucking and then Aphrodite later proposing her love to her half-brother, Ares. Hermes additionally views her half-brother Hephaestus as a more father figure , and Aphrodite was already with her half-brother Hephaestus now making this a public affair.
