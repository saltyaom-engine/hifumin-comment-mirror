It just went from bad to cringe and worse. But the action scenes were pretty good, and if they`re not talking about the forced \"romance\"parts, it was kinda good. Talking about forced romance parts, i would expect that there would be atleast some NTR or rape hentai from this show. Kinda disappointed, since in the end it looked like pretty much a NTR story. But then again, it`s not like they`re superhot, so we`re not really missing much.\nAlso @SYNDIKATE, i`ve a feeling you either didn`t watch much anime at all, or are way too young to have been here. But you might be old enough now(hopefully), so your tastes probably have changed too."},{"id":1224948,"gallery_id":224150,"poster":{"id":3556405,"username":":!","slug":"_","avatar_url":"avatars/3556405.png?_=d6dcd0e9edb77342","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1600748411,"body":"O shit here comes Ohagi man"},{"id":955530,"gallery_id":224150,"poster":{"id":1941557,"username":"ghostikko","slug":"ghostikko","avatar_url":"avatars/1941557.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1561692514,"body":"Does the manga have sae in it?"},{"id":855458,"gallery_id":224150,"poster":{"id":1106863,"username":"GamingSlayerNS","slug":"gamingslayerns","avatar_url":"avatars/1106863.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1553491058,"body":"Yep,this was insanely good.
