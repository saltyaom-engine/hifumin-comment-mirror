I made a mistake and used \"his\" instead of \"her\" when I first mentioned it. Just gonna point it out in case it has misled some to think the other way. Also, just to further explain, MC is taking advantage of FMC here but to MC, it doesn't really matter to him if FMC chose to decline his offer to help. He's kinda portrayed as an apathetic guy in a sense. For the most part, it's his own survival and needs that he prioritizes so if FMC declined there, it's just one thing off the things he has responsibility for. His action is evil, but he isn't quite an evil character here. I mean, he's meeting his ends of the deal by ensuring the 3 are alive.

Another is a flashback detailing FMC's story. Their fam was attacked as they were evacuating along with their neighbors. The 3 of em found the building they were now trapped in and there were a lot of people there at first. But knowing that they can't stay there forever cuz food and stuff, people after people started venturing out but failed to return. Eventually, it was just the 3 of em and a creepy dude. Scared, she locked themselves away from the dude and we never saw him again. Thinking back, these two are actually kinda relevant and I should've included em. My bad.

As they talked, FMC realized that she still needs MC to survive, so she decided to pay him back with the real deal sex at night. She was a virgin.Next scene, MC eventually cleared the lower floor of the building FMC's stuck in of zombies so they looted for stuff. They also had sex while she's wearing a school uniform. Little by little, FMC seems to enjoy their sex now. Anyway, next scene MC got a radio call from a school. They are asking for help, so MC decided to go on his own. To his surprise, the whole place is infested. Not only that, there seems to be a male zombie that is much stronger and more intelligent than the usual. He found a video cam in which he was able to theorize that the more humans zombies eat, the closer they get to having human-like traits. He didn't like this. As he was about to leave, he saw a female zombie wielding a weapon. He got back to FMC's place but something doesn't feel right.

Anyway, here's a summary: (1/2) MC got bitten by some dude, he got sick, and locked himself up for days. When he woke up, zombie apocalypse happened and for some reason, he's the only one that zombies don't attack. He later found a zombified hot neighbor who he locked up in her flat and use for his sexual needs. Anyway, he freely goes around the city and found FMC and his 2 lil bros stuck in building. He decided to help em without telling his special ability. At some point, he felt that it's pointless to help em so he offered for FMC to pay with her body. Desperation calls and she eventually did it with her hand. (MC isnt necessarily portrayed as an evil character here but yeah). FMC had enough and decided to escape with her bros, but MC managed to stop and save them. He was mad at her for her stupidity.
