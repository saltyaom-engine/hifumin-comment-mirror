Was she warned when she became this type of creature (if she was changed into one)? Did she attempt to eat a female and suffer some kind of poisoning? Maybe she's physically unable to harm them because of a restriction in their race?\n\nAnd as for the falling idea, the connection between the silk and flesh is too smooth to be from a crushed limb (and it wouldn't make sense that any limb would be intact in a fall that would damage 3 of them to the point surgical amputation would be required.

If he can't move his hand they will have to work together to roll her \"joints.\" There are so many questions! I've decided to work on writing a fanfic about this story since I keep coming back to it. Do a little backstory on how she lived before the story starts, how she was captured, then a little about what happened next. She called losing her limbs an amputation, which is a medical procedure, and not that they hacked them off her which would make for a grimmer story. Was she injured or is it a translation error.

I'm sure it's probably thickly woven, so it would stop blood loss and allow a bit of support on it (standing up), but the big question is how the joints would work, because she put quite a lot of effort into the hand to mimic the nails, muscle structure, and segmenting of the hand for it to just be decorative."},{"id":107828,"gallery_id":188104,"poster":{"id":1055920,"username":"Folker46","slug":"folker46","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1491475602,"body":"I'm not sure she's being sadistic, up until she bites his arm off I think she thought she really was going to eat him but then something happened.

That's a lot of work for someone in her condition, more work then she needed to do just to keep him alive. She took tender care of him, when she could have just bound his arm and left him lying in his own blood. She showed a shocking level of concern for his comfort. I think the fact that eating him would make her stronger and yet she restrained herself shows she loves him but maybe I'm just being romantic. I wonder how magical her silk is?

It's also because of her kindness towards him (or at least her lack of searing hatred, as even her announcement that she's going to east him has some sarcastic politeness and she said she'd listen to his last words, something he believes he wouldn't receive from others), after never having any form of it before.
