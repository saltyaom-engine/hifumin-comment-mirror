I remember reading this up to chapter 13 what had to be years ago and lost touch with it. Good to see the ending, but honestly I'm both disappointed and not. I feel so sorry for her. She did love him, but obligations forced her to part. Getting together with him towards the end was consummating their feelings, but also allowing her to move on and resign herself to her debt issues. Only problem is she never really moved on. She regrets it to this day, but persists on her path because that's what she had to do and all she has left. I don't really like endings like that, but I have to say at the same time, I'm glad Noriko wasn't left alone at the end."},{"id":150506,"gallery_id":203468,"poster":{"id":588613,"username":"zeupiter","slug":"zeupiter","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1502313254,"body":"from what i managed to understand, long hair girl and MC were in love with each other but she was in massive debt and tried to keep working in the entertainment industry to pay it off but ended up failing, now she runs a club(hostess club probably) and was banging the guy that invested in the club, but in the end she never forgot about the MC and keeps remembering the time with him.  MC however was brokenhearted, manga girl comforted him and he found an outlet in manga and they ended up together, so happy ending for him i suppose."},{"id":150457,"gallery_id":203468,"poster":{"id":180403,"username":"achraf06xavi","slug":"achraf06xavi","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1502304069,"body":"interesting!"},{"id":150439,"gallery_id":203468,"poster":{"id":1093418,"username":"gospelkiru","slug":"gospelkiru","avatar_url":"avatars/1093418.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1502298132,"body":"Why did the girl runaway?\nOhh well Id*ot be like her."},{"id":150437,"gallery_id":203468,"poster":{"id":521269,"username":"God Knight","slug":"god-knight","avatar_url":"avatars/521269.png?_=ec0db7bbd95b84eb","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1502296665,"body":"what the hell.
