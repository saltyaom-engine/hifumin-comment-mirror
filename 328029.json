Can we go off topic for a moment and not talk about the yaoi? (It was so fucking good, ngl) For some reason, Fizzcode's AnE djs always have the exact same vibe that Yuki's and Rin's brotherly \"love\" have in the canon work whenever they want. Just in this one, for example; when Mephisto offeree the key to Yukio, he said \"Would you rather respect your brother's wishes, or follow your own desires?\" When Yukio answered to that as \"I only want to protect my brother\" is exactly what he dies in the manga. Covering up malicioua intentions with sweet words everyone wants to hear, specially towards Rin. As the story continues, we see how much of Rin & Yukio's relationship is one-sided, with Rin constantly looking after and worrying for Yukio, while Yukio *trying* to stick to the promise he made to his father: Protect his brother. Despite not giving 2 flying fucks about Rin's (mental) health, and only caring about \"protecting\" him--"},{"id":1201347,"gallery_id":328029,"poster":{"id":3514626,"username":"ShowerTime!!","slug":"showertime","avatar_url":"avatars/3514626.png?_=85d067c965a1f3fd","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1599669473,"body":"Fizzcode is the best at Blue Exorcist doujins!!!\ud83d\ude01"},{"id":1198352,"gallery_id":328029,"poster":{"id":3575802,"username":"gin-chan-aru","slug":"gin-chan-aru","avatar_url":"avatars/3575802.png?_=1d645adec5530385","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1599530423,"body":"D A M N \ud83d\ude33 "},{"id":1197882,"gallery_id":328029,"poster":{"id":1872506,"username":"God has forsaken all of us","slug":"god-has-forsaken-all-of-us","avatar_url":"avatars/1872506.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1599508513,"body":":^) oh boy"},{"id":1197857,"gallery_id":328029,"poster":{"id":1568108,"username":"Demon Usamaro","slug":"demon-usamaro","avatar_url":"avatars/1568108.png?_=7b801144a6c4fe37","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1599507414,"body":"This hurts me dearly"}]
