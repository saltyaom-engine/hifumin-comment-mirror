In that doujin it is stated that Yotsuba will only be added when She and Fuutarou are divorced but in this one She is already in it at high school so it is two different canon. The author could have just made this a sequel to the Adult Miku doujin by drawing them as milfs (that would be hot) and there would be contunity or he could just exclude Yotsuba or have her actually leave. Again call me crazy for caring about such irellevant things in a NTR doujin but it was a good oportunity for a sequel and it would have not even be NTR since Yotsuba would be divorced. Like I personally do not consider the Miku one NTR because it happens after the manga ended and thus Miku already lost so She can fuck anyone she wants and it would not be related to Fuutarou"}]
