There are things that are left unclear or felt inconsistent. Succubus here seems to be treated like joining prostitution agency (they're not born as one, except the princess and the pure demons). There are inconsistency about if they're still succubus or not, like Mako said she can't use magic after losing her crest, but she can use it in later chapter. Also later when she and Yui return to Earth (while Yoshio is tasked for Demon World domination), they are almost normal human again, but during their date, she can transform into succubus again. Any schedule for compiled volume of this?"},{"id":2463450,"gallery_id":399595,"poster":{"id":125817,"username":"riotrooper","slug":"riotrooper","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1650158811,"body":"there are some pages lost, please check"}]
