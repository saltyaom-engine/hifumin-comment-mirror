The MC even has a future and a good chance whith his girl , the only thing that is a true problem is the time far from her but probably this distance wont change anything because this always happens to they . What is really sad isnt the plot but the way the MC deals with the changes in his life . What we truly have here ,ma boys  , is the rise of a man.

If you make a 20 pg doujinshi, know your purpose. Is the purpose to put in some melancholy slice of life, or is it about some fun youth times and what not? In the world of fantasy you are the shaper of destiny, and if deep down in your heart you want a happy ending for these kids, then what's stopping you? Life, ethics, reality, and people can be whatever you want, yet you choose this? We understand this well enough in life, all of us do at some point. Give us soup for the soul, the one that will fill us up and make us warm, and when we lay in bed we will sleep so peacefully. This doujinshi... it is what we know and want, but it isn't what we need. The doujinshi that bridges life with mature content has yet to arrive, and if none of you will be the one to do it then give me the pen and I will show you how it's done.
