(You'll get the Jap AND Chinese LONG before you'll see a DECENT English!) unless the artist/group are extremely popular! Is there something behind the scenes I don't know about (like for example, just like what's attracting copy cats to NTR, is their alot more money to be made ENG translating NTR then the others?)"},{"id":1905620,"gallery_id":360642,"poster":{"id":2555115,"username":"i_love_futa_dick","slug":"i_love_futa_dick","avatar_url":"avatars/2555115.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1627532150,"body":"I like this artist"}]
