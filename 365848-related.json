Tomo didn't divorce his wife but continued with their married life. Thing is tho is that shiori knew that he wasn't interested in her yet they dated, after she introduced tomo to her mother shimako she knew from the way tomo looked that who tomo really likes was her mother. But she was kinda OK with it from how I see it (albeit still a sad thing for me a bit) because she knows that tomo likes shimako and that she can be with tomo was also because of shimako, so she accepts this situation. Tho I doubt the two fuckwits noticed that she was already aware or that tomo noticed but shut ups about it and continues to his plan on conquering shimako."},{"id":1871737,"gallery_id":365848,"poster":{"id":1100179,"username":"GayFandomGaveNoShit","slug":"gayfandomgavenoshit","avatar_url":"avatars/1100179.png?_=9d1cd8b1a3991414","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1626275863,"body":"That's hot better than some demon slayer gay shit "},{"id":1870964,"gallery_id":365848,"poster":{"id":2564825,"username":"BZo1480","slug":"bzo1480","avatar_url":"avatars/2564825.png?_=3ff4cbfcb1167fd4","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1626247679,"body":"So he divorced the wife and married her mom?
