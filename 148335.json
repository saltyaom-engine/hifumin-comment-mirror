She appears in one other DxD doujin, but Rias is really the only one Issei does much with... Which is understandable, of course. I mean, I'm perfectly okay with that, but...

The physical contact (or lack thereof) aside, if I wanted to see the female characters without any clothes... Well, that's what the anime/manga/etc is there for. But yeah, good stuff here. &gt;w&lt;"}]
