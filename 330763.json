If you quickly look closely at the \"vaginal discharge\" in the vaginal orifice (vaginal canal entrance), the discharge looks YELLOW, that is a very likely indication of STD infection. Normal discharge should be clear and liquidy and maybe slightly white sometimes but never thick or lumpy white. You wanna hit a girl with that kind of discharge color? Be my guest, good luck to you LMAO. I'd suggest to the girl to go see a doctor if that happens."},{"id":1243414,"gallery_id":330763,"poster":{"id":3672256,"username":"DirtyHarry001","slug":"dirtyharry001","avatar_url":"avatars/3672256.png?_=025988913c898729","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1601433754,"body":"If you ask for translations you die"}]
