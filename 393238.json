The thing Satori dislike, \u540c\u6027\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c8, is not flirting. It\u2019s more like other female flaunting superiority (like talking about being spoiled by fabulous boyfriend, or getting things everybody wants) while belittling other. For guys, it's like when your acquaintance starts talking about how he's richer, got better career, having sexy girlfriend, while pointing out you don't. Fucking annoying. The ex's profile got some red flags. He's marrying for his career (company only trust married person for position with higher responsibility); and \"mentally unstable woman\" can just be self-justification because he doesn't want to bother in understanding his partner.
