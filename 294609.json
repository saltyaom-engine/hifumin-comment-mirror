Although it does balance it out a bit that there was both a boy version and a girl version. Still though, if a guy should get his ass kicked for peeping at the girls, the girl should get her ass kicked for peeping at the boys. There shouldn\u2019t be gender specific perks in society, because we\u2019re all humans, we just play different parts."}]
