The NTR fake-out was so interesting. It\u2019s like the wife did this to show Sekawa she\u2019s not interested in him. The thing where the husband\u2019s gonna arrive late, but is just fifteen minutes late was so funny. Using NTR conventions then subverting our expectations. It\u2019s also the opposite of NTR where the person the wife trusts to tell her kinks is the husband and not some random outsider. Page 4 is interesting cause she clearly leads him into the \u201cbaby\u201d room to set him up."},{"id":852347,"gallery_id":10222,"poster":{"id":287754,"username":"Skelter92","slug":"skelter92","avatar_url":"avatars/287754.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1553224345,"body":"Not really ntr since he isnt in a relationship with her"},{"id":69049,"gallery_id":10222,"poster":{"id":663188,"username":"robinv","slug":"robinv","avatar_url":"avatars/663188.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1477460231,"body":"Just a bit of scat.
