Okay, this establishes that she's doing this to help her husband, but zero idea why, zero idea if the husband made her do this, etc. Then at the end she learns hubby had been embezzling from the company spending the money on his mistress.  Lost in translation? Still no evidence that she's a mother. The implication is that she's sacrificing herself for her husband, yet he betrayed her.  In this case, 2 sentences don't make a plot.
