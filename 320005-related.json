In page 1 we see her in her mid 20's walking around with young jack, and then when we see a grownup jack, we also see a far younger granadine, i'd say 16 years younger. Of course if she ages backwards, the logical natural end of her life wouldn't be to go back into a sperm and dissapear, but rather i'd be dying of natural causes when her body becomes TOO young which makes more sense, like she might be 10 here (physically ofc), and we know that the average human rarely lives past 90 years old. 1/2"},{"id":1072739,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":1644592,"username":"John Paul II","slug":"john-paul-ii","avatar_url":"avatars/1644592.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594516258,"body":"So short but still so deep, I love this artist and I hope he's gonna do more "},{"id":1072545,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":3266183,"username":"John lannery","slug":"john-lannery","avatar_url":"avatars/3266183.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594507311,"body":"I can't believe this made me cry"},{"id":1072000,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":1287317,"username":"Mivy","slug":"mivy","avatar_url":"avatars/1287317.png?_=8cca85752bcdec44","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594485512,"body":"DAMN! the feels"},{"id":1071655,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":585446,"username":"smolenjoyer","slug":"smolenjoyer","avatar_url":"avatars/585446.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594473434,"body":"Beautiful art and a cute story, very nice"},{"id":1071017,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":1997225,"username":"Freedom-Kun","slug":"freedom-kun","avatar_url":"avatars/pastamania.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594451591,"body":"My heart such wholesome such wow"},{"id":1070973,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":3434155,"username":"Rickmarinara","slug":"rickmarinara","avatar_url":"avatars/3434155.png?_=c4acb13f3feb232a","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594450201,"body":"Very wholesome can't wait for them to have kids "},{"id":1070872,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":1268563,"username":"Mayks","slug":"mayks","avatar_url":"avatars/1268563.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594447396,"body":"I came for a nut but go with tears"},{"id":1070829,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":732603,"username":"Tristan182","slug":"tristan182","avatar_url":"avatars/732603.png?_=eedd23ca5af4c68b","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594446065,"body":"Damn this is really heartwarming yet it did have those sad undertones. 10/10"},{"id":1070759,"gallery_id":320005,"poster":{"id":2510710,"username":"Shu~","slug":"shu","avatar_url":"avatars/2510710.png?_=b789620084c44886","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1594443264,"body":"Yall talking bout the story while im asking myself why tf his face a square.
