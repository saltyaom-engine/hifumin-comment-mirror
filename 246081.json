This entry feature 7 other AL ship girls as well as Illustrious and Unicorn for a total of 9 characters. Each character got 4 pages there was no favoritism for Illustrious and Unicorn here so I really don't know what your complaining about since this basically fulfilled your request. On a different note it was a real treat getting Graf Zeppelin drawn by Oyari Ashiro in this. Though I would've liked her to look a bit more serious (thats kinda her thing) and Queen Elizabeth and Hammann were also not giving off any of their respective trademark himedere and Tsundere vibes. Still with Oyari Ashiro behind the wheel with the art I'll forgive such oversights."},{"id":804348,"gallery_id":246081,"poster":{"id":830575,"username":"NorwegianboyEE","slug":"norwegianboyee","avatar_url":"avatars/830575.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1548978053,"body":"Comiket 93"},{"id":790427,"gallery_id":246081,"poster":{"id":2108722,"username":"i write reviews","slug":"i-write-reviews","avatar_url":"avatars/2108722.png","is_superuser":false,"is_staff":false},"post_date":1547760800,"body":"What does C93 mean?
