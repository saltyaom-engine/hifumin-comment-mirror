If you don't get to see that process then the whole experience just loses its impact. That's where Carn comes up short. In almost all of their works it's just 0 to 100. You're here and then you're there and it happens way too fast.

Some of the best NTRtists focus on that element and it's sexy as hell seeing a girl spiral into sexual hell. Carn just throws women into situations and it just happens like here you just get a couple panels showing her guilt than bam next scene she's immediately sucking dick.\n\nGreat art but bad execution.
