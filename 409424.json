Meaning he was never seeing HER, just her mother And once she realizes that, that will really break her spirit! It means \"Uncle\" never loved her, not truly! Every time they did it, he was thinking of her mother and used the \"Cat\" crap to hide and justify!) But hey, it was better for her CF!

It's awkward like it was when they were young and with that in mind! And they talk! Turns out the scumbag died a few years into the \"marriage (Frankly I set it where their 30 now!) she's had to raise the two kids she had with him alone! The money he left behind long run out and frankly without being cock crazy, finally got to realizing how fucked up it all was and how she fucked up and tries to see if they could hook up!
